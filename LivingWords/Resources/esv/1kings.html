<p id="calibre_link-14210" class="heading">David in His Old Age</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1973">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Now King David was old and advanced in years. And although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm. <span id="calibre_link-24753" class="verse-num">2</span>Therefore his servants said to him, "Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm." <span id="calibre_link-24754" class="verse-num">3</span>So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <span id="calibre_link-24755" class="verse-num">4</span>The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9729" class="heading">Adonijah Sets Himself Up as King</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king." And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <span id="calibre_link-24756" class="verse-num">6</span>His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, "Why have you done thus and so?" He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom. <span id="calibre_link-9588" class="verse-num">7</span>He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him. <span id="calibre_link-8082" class="verse-num">8</span>But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David's mighty men were not with Adonijah.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24757"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, <span id="calibre_link-5003" class="verse-num">10</span>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24758" class="heading">Nathan and Bathsheba Before David</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, "Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it? <span id="calibre_link-24759" class="verse-num">12</span>Now therefore come, let me give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. <span id="calibre_link-24760" class="verse-num">13</span>Go in at once to King David, and say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne"? Why then is Adonijah king?' <span id="calibre_link-24761" class="verse-num">14</span>Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24762"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king). <span id="calibre_link-24763" class="verse-num">16</span>Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, "What do you desire?" <span id="calibre_link-24764" class="verse-num">17</span>She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your servant by the LORD your God, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.' <span id="calibre_link-24765" class="verse-num">18</span>And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it. <span id="calibre_link-24766" class="verse-num">19</span>He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he has not invited. <span id="calibre_link-24767" class="verse-num">20</span>And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. <span id="calibre_link-24768" class="verse-num">21</span>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24769"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <span id="calibre_link-24770" class="verse-num">23</span>And they told the king, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground. <span id="calibre_link-24771" class="verse-num">24</span>And Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne'? <span id="calibre_link-24772" class="verse-num">25</span>For he has gone down this day and has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' <span id="calibre_link-24773" class="verse-num">26</span>But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited. <span id="calibre_link-24774" class="verse-num">27</span>Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12784" class="heading">Solomon Anointed King</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>Then King David answered, "Call Bathsheba to me." So she came into the king's presence and stood before the king. <span id="calibre_link-24775" class="verse-num">29</span>And the king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity, <span id="calibre_link-24776" class="verse-num">30</span>as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,' even so will I do this day." <span id="calibre_link-24777" class="verse-num">31</span>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, "May my lord King David live forever!"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24778"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." So they came before the king. <span id="calibre_link-24779" class="verse-num">33</span>And the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. <span id="calibre_link-24780" class="verse-num">34</span>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!' <span id="calibre_link-24781" class="verse-num">35</span>You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah." <span id="calibre_link-24782" class="verse-num">36</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so. <span id="calibre_link-24783" class="verse-num">37</span>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24784"> <span class="verse-num">38</span>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David's mule and brought him to Gihon. <span id="calibre_link-24785" class="verse-num">39</span>There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!" <span id="calibre_link-24786" class="verse-num">40</span>And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24787"> <span class="verse-num">41</span>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "What does this uproar in the city mean?" <span id="calibre_link-24788" class="verse-num">42</span>While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news." <span id="calibre_link-7622" class="verse-num">43</span>Jonathan answered Adonijah, "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king, <span id="calibre_link-24789" class="verse-num">44</span>and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they had him ride on the king's mule. <span id="calibre_link-24790" class="verse-num">45</span>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard. <span id="calibre_link-24791" class="verse-num">46</span>Solomon sits on the royal throne. <span id="calibre_link-24792" class="verse-num">47</span>Moreover, the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself on the bed. <span id="calibre_link-24793" class="verse-num">48</span>And the king also said, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24794"> <span class="verse-num">49</span>Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose, and each went his own way. <span id="calibre_link-9730" class="verse-num">50</span>And Adonijah feared Solomon. So he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar. <span id="calibre_link-24795" class="verse-num">51</span>Then it was told Solomon, "Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'" <span id="calibre_link-24796" class="verse-num">52</span>And Solomon said, "If he will show himself a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die." <span id="calibre_link-24797" class="verse-num">53</span>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-14211" class="heading">David's Instructions to Solomon</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1973">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>When David's time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying, <span id="calibre_link-24798" class="verse-num">2</span>"I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man, <span id="calibre_link-24799" class="verse-num">3</span>and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn, <span id="calibre_link-24800" class="verse-num">4</span>that the LORD may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, 'If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.'</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24801"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>"Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet. <span id="calibre_link-24802" class="verse-num">6</span>Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. <span id="calibre_link-24803" class="verse-num">7</span>But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. <span id="calibre_link-24804" class="verse-num">8</span>And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, 'I will not put you to death with the sword.' <span id="calibre_link-24805" class="verse-num">9</span>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24806" class="heading">The Death of David</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. <span id="calibre_link-24807" class="verse-num">11</span>And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-24808" class="verse-num">12</span>So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24809" class="heading">Solomon's Reign Established</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, "Do you come peacefully?" He said, "Peacefully." <span id="calibre_link-24810" class="verse-num">14</span>Then he said, "I have something to say to you." She said, "Speak." <span id="calibre_link-24811" class="verse-num">15</span>He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD. <span id="calibre_link-24812" class="verse-num">16</span>And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me." She said to him, "Speak." <span id="calibre_link-24813" class="verse-num">17</span>And he said, "Please ask King Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife." <span id="calibre_link-24814" class="verse-num">18</span>Bathsheba said, "Very well; I will speak for you to the king."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24815"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king's mother, and she sat on his right. <span id="calibre_link-24816" class="verse-num">20</span>Then she said, "I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you." <span id="calibre_link-24817" class="verse-num">21</span>She said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife." <span id="calibre_link-24818" class="verse-num">22</span>King Solomon answered his mother, "And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah." <span id="calibre_link-24819" class="verse-num">23</span>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, "God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life! <span id="calibre_link-24820" class="verse-num">24</span>Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today." <span id="calibre_link-24821" class="verse-num">25</span>So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24822"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord G<span class="calibre11">OD</span> before David my father, and because you shared in all my father's affliction." <span id="calibre_link-24823" class="verse-num">27</span>So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24824"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>When the news came to Joab-for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom-Joab fled to the tent of the LORD and caught hold of the horns of the altar. <span id="calibre_link-24825" class="verse-num">29</span>And when it was told King Solomon, "Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar," Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, "Go, strike him down." <span id="calibre_link-24826" class="verse-num">30</span>So Benaiah came to the tent of the LORD and said to him, "The king commands, 'Come out.'" But he said, "No, I will die here." Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me." <span id="calibre_link-1321" class="verse-num">31</span>The king replied to him, "Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause. <span id="calibre_link-24827" class="verse-num">32</span>The LORD will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. <span id="calibre_link-24828" class="verse-num">33</span>So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the LORD forevermore." <span id="calibre_link-24829" class="verse-num">34</span>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. <span id="calibre_link-24830" class="verse-num">35</span>The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24831"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever. <span id="calibre_link-24832" class="verse-num">37</span>For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head." <span id="calibre_link-24833" class="verse-num">38</span>And Shimei said to the king, "What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24834"> <span class="verse-num">39</span>But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei's servants ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, "Behold, your servants are in Gath," <span id="calibre_link-24835" class="verse-num">40</span>Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. <span id="calibre_link-24836" class="verse-num">41</span>And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned, <span id="calibre_link-24837" class="verse-num">42</span>the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, 'Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die'? And you said to me, 'What you say is good; I will obey.' <span id="calibre_link-24838" class="verse-num">43</span>Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the commandment with which I commanded you?" <span id="calibre_link-24839" class="verse-num">44</span>The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father. So the LORD will bring back your harm on your own head. <span id="calibre_link-24840" class="verse-num">45</span>But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever." <span id="calibre_link-24841" class="verse-num">46</span>Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died.</p>
<p class="crossway">So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-14212" class="heading">Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1973">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh's daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-15864" class="verse-num">2</span>The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7623"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places. <span id="calibre_link-24842" class="verse-num">4</span>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. <span id="calibre_link-867" class="verse-num">5</span>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, "Ask what I shall give you." <span id="calibre_link-24843" class="verse-num">6</span>And Solomon said, "You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. <span id="calibre_link-24844" class="verse-num">7</span>And now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. <span id="calibre_link-24845" class="verse-num">8</span>And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. <span id="calibre_link-24846" class="verse-num">9</span>Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24847"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. <span id="calibre_link-15522" class="verse-num">11</span>And God said to him, "Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, <span id="calibre_link-11671" class="verse-num">12</span>behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. <span id="calibre_link-24848" class="verse-num">13</span>I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. <span id="calibre_link-24849" class="verse-num">14</span>And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24850"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8668" class="heading">Solomon's Wisdom</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. <span id="calibre_link-24851" class="verse-num">17</span>The one woman said, "Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. <span id="calibre_link-24852" class="verse-num">18</span>Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24913"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3947"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. <span id="calibre_link-24935" class="verse-num">32</span>He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24936"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square, <span id="calibre_link-24937" class="verse-num">34</span>and two doors of cypress wood.

<p id="calibre_link-25077" class="heading">Solomon's Great Wealth</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, <span id="calibre_link-25078" class="verse-num">15</span>besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land. <span id="calibre_link-25079" class="verse-num">16</span>King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield. <span id="calibre_link-25080" class="verse-num">17</span>And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield.

Solomon clung to these in love. <span id="calibre_link-11694" class="verse-num">3</span>He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. <span id="calibre_link-25093" class="verse-num">4</span>For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. <span id="calibre_link-13930" class="verse-num">5</span>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <span id="calibre_link-25094" class="verse-num">6</span>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done. <span id="calibre_link-25095" class="verse-num">7</span>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-25096" class="verse-num">8</span>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25101"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25113"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. <span id="calibre_link-25114" class="verse-num">27</span>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. <span id="calibre_link-25115" class="verse-num">28</span>The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. <span id="calibre_link-25116" class="verse-num">29</span>And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25127"> <span class="verse-num">41</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? <span id="calibre_link-25128" class="verse-num">42</span>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span id="calibre_link-15433" class="verse-num">43</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father.

<p id="calibre_link-14217" class="heading">Rehoboam's Folly</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1973">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 12 </span>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <span id="calibre_link-25129" class="verse-num">2</span>And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. <span id="calibre_link-25130" class="verse-num">3</span>And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam, <span id="calibre_link-1128" class="verse-num">4</span>"Your father made our yoke heavy.

So the people went away.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15434"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, "How do you advise me to answer this people?" <span id="calibre_link-25132" class="verse-num">7</span>And they said to him, "If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever." <span id="calibre_link-25133" class="verse-num">8</span>But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. <span id="calibre_link-25134" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to them, "What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?" <span id="calibre_link-25135" class="verse-num">10</span>And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, "Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us,' thus shall you say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs. <span id="calibre_link-9724" class="verse-num">11</span>And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25136"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, "Come to me again the third day." <span id="calibre_link-25137" class="verse-num">13</span>And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him, <span id="calibre_link-25138" class="verse-num">14</span>he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions." <span id="calibre_link-25139" class="verse-num">15</span>So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfill his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-25140" class="heading">The Kingdom Divided</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, "What portion do we have in David?

So Israel went to their tents. <span id="calibre_link-25141" class="verse-num">17</span>But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. <span id="calibre_link-25142" class="verse-num">18</span>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25144"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <span id="calibre_link-25145" class="verse-num">22</span>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: <span id="calibre_link-25146" class="verse-num">23</span>"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, <span id="calibre_link-25147" class="verse-num">24</span>'Thus says the LORD, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel.

<p id="calibre_link-25148" class="heading">Jeroboam's Golden Calves</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1973">1 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 18 </span>After many days the word of the LORD came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth." <span id="calibre_link-6975" class="verse-num">2</span>So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <span id="calibre_link-25294" class="verse-num">3</span>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <span id="calibre_link-1318" class="verse-num">4</span>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <span id="calibre_link-25295" class="verse-num">5</span>And Ahab said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25297"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him.

Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here.'" <span id="calibre_link-25299" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said, "How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <span id="calibre_link-25300" class="verse-num">10</span>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25306"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, "Is it you, you troubler of Israel?" <span id="calibre_link-25307" class="verse-num">18</span>And he answered, "I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <span id="calibre_link-10167" class="verse-num">19</span>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-2868" class="heading">The Prophets of Baal Defeated</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <span id="calibre_link-4040" class="verse-num">21</span>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, "How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him." And the people did not answer him a word. <span id="calibre_link-25308" class="verse-num">22</span>Then Elijah said to the people, "I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal's prophets are 450 men. <span id="calibre_link-25309" class="verse-num">23</span>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it.

And all the people answered, "It is well spoken." <span id="calibre_link-13306" class="verse-num">25</span>Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it." <span id="calibre_link-25310" class="verse-num">26</span>And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no voice, and no one answered.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9858"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come near to me." And all the people came near to him.

And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <span id="calibre_link-1192" class="verse-num">33</span>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, "Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood." <span id="calibre_link-25315" class="verse-num">34</span>And he said, "Do it a second time." And they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time." And they did it a third time. <span id="calibre_link-25316" class="verse-num">35</span>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25317"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <span id="calibre_link-9974" class="verse-num">37</span>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back." <span id="calibre_link-12263" class="verse-num">38</span>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <span id="calibre_link-25318" class="verse-num">39</span>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, "The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God." <span id="calibre_link-25319" class="verse-num">40</span>And Elijah said to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape."
