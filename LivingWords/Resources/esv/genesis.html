And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7257"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." <span id="calibre_link-17415" class="verse-num">7</span>And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17416"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. <span id="calibre_link-3723" class="verse-num">10</span>God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12393"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth." And it was so. <span id="calibre_link-8881" class="verse-num">12</span>The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <span id="calibre_link-17417" class="verse-num">13</span>And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1107"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night.

And it was so. <span id="calibre_link-7768" class="verse-num">16</span>And God made the two great lights&mdash;the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night&mdash;and the stars. <span id="calibre_link-17419" class="verse-num">17</span>And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, <span id="calibre_link-15598" class="verse-num">18</span>to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. <span id="calibre_link-17420" class="verse-num">19</span>And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17421"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens." <span id="calibre_link-17422" class="verse-num">21</span>So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <span id="calibre_link-4724" class="verse-num">22</span>And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." <span id="calibre_link-17423" class="verse-num">23</span>And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-3535" class="line-group"> <span class="verse-num">27</span> So God created man in his own image,</p>

And it was so. <span id="calibre_link-13411" class="verse-num">31</span>And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.

<p id="calibre_link-6448" class="heading">The Seventh Day, God Rests</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1963">GENESIS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. <span id="calibre_link-7309" class="verse-num">2</span>And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. <span id="calibre_link-15873" class="verse-num">3</span>So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-15552" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. <span id="calibre_link-17426" class="verse-num">11</span>The name of the first is the Pishon.

And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. <span id="calibre_link-17713" class="verse-num">3</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife." <span id="calibre_link-17714" class="verse-num">4</span>Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, "Lord, will you kill an innocent people? <span id="calibre_link-17715" class="verse-num">5</span>Did he not himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this." <span id="calibre_link-17716" class="verse-num">6</span>Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. <span id="calibre_link-17717" class="verse-num">7</span>Now then, return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17718"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. <span id="calibre_link-17719" class="verse-num">9</span>Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done." <span id="calibre_link-17720" class="verse-num">10</span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you did this thing?" <span id="calibre_link-17721" class="verse-num">11</span>Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, 'There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.' <span id="calibre_link-17722" class="verse-num">12</span>Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. <span id="calibre_link-17723" class="verse-num">13</span>And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, "He is my brother."'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17724"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <span id="calibre_link-17725" class="verse-num">15</span>And Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you." <span id="calibre_link-17726" class="verse-num">16</span>To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated." <span id="calibre_link-9604" class="verse-num">17</span>Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. <span id="calibre_link-17727" class="verse-num">18</span>For the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-17733" class="heading">God Protects Hagar and Ishmael</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And the child grew and was weaned.

Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. <span id="calibre_link-17736" class="verse-num">13</span>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring." <span id="calibre_link-17737" class="verse-num">14</span>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17738"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. <span id="calibre_link-17739" class="verse-num">16</span>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, "Let me not look on the death of the child." And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. <span id="calibre_link-17740" class="verse-num">17</span>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. <span id="calibre_link-17741" class="verse-num">18</span>Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation." <span id="calibre_link-17742" class="verse-num">19</span>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. <span id="calibre_link-17743" class="verse-num">20</span>And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. <span id="calibre_link-17744" class="verse-num">21</span>He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9605" class="heading">A Treaty with Abimelech</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, "God is with you in all that you do. <span id="calibre_link-17745" class="verse-num">23</span>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned." <span id="calibre_link-17746" class="verse-num">24</span>And Abraham said, "I will swear."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-17747"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized, <span id="calibre_link-17748" class="verse-num">26</span>Abimelech said, "I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today." <span id="calibre_link-17749" class="verse-num">27</span>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. <span id="calibre_link-17750" class="verse-num">28</span>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. <span id="calibre_link-17751" class="verse-num">29</span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?" <span id="calibre_link-17752" class="verse-num">30</span>He said, "These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well." <span id="calibre_link-17753" class="verse-num">31</span>Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath. <span id="calibre_link-12819" class="verse-num">32</span>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. <span id="calibre_link-17754" class="verse-num">33</span>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, the Everlasting God. <span id="calibre_link-17755" class="verse-num">34</span>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9165"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <span id="calibre_link-17761" class="verse-num">10</span>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. <span id="calibre_link-9910" class="verse-num">11</span>But the angel of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!"

But God did not permit him to harm me. <span id="calibre_link-18025" class="verse-num">8</span>If he said, 'The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, 'The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped. <span id="calibre_link-18026" class="verse-num">9</span>Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me. <span id="calibre_link-18027" class="verse-num">10</span>In the breeding season of the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled. <span id="calibre_link-18028" class="verse-num">11</span>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!' <span id="calibre_link-18029" class="verse-num">12</span>And he said, 'Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. <span id="calibre_link-18030" class="verse-num">13</span>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred.'" <span id="calibre_link-18031" class="verse-num">14</span>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house? <span id="calibre_link-18032" class="verse-num">15</span>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <span id="calibre_link-18033" class="verse-num">16</span>All the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18034"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <span id="calibre_link-18035" class="verse-num">18</span>He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac. <span id="calibre_link-18036" class="verse-num">19</span>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods. <span id="calibre_link-18037" class="verse-num">20</span>And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean, by not telling him that he intended to flee. <span id="calibre_link-18038" class="verse-num">21</span>He fled with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18039"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <span id="calibre_link-18040" class="verse-num">23</span>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead. <span id="calibre_link-18041" class="verse-num">24</span>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8341"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead. <span id="calibre_link-18042" class="verse-num">26</span>And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have tricked me and driven away my daughters like captives of the sword? <span id="calibre_link-18043" class="verse-num">27</span>Why did you flee secretly and trick me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre? <span id="calibre_link-18044" class="verse-num">28</span>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly. <span id="calibre_link-18045" class="verse-num">29</span>It is in my power to do you harm. But the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.' <span id="calibre_link-18046" class="verse-num">30</span>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?" <span id="calibre_link-18047" class="verse-num">31</span>Jacob answered and said to Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force. <span id="calibre_link-18048" class="verse-num">32</span>Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18049"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's. <span id="calibre_link-18050" class="verse-num">34</span>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them. <span id="calibre_link-18051" class="verse-num">35</span>And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched but did not find the household gods.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18052"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>Then Jacob became angry and berated Laban. Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? <span id="calibre_link-18053" class="verse-num">37</span>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two. <span id="calibre_link-18054" class="verse-num">38</span>These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks. <span id="calibre_link-18055" class="verse-num">39</span>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <span id="calibre_link-18056" class="verse-num">40</span>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. <span id="calibre_link-18057" class="verse-num">41</span>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <span id="calibre_link-18058" class="verse-num">42</span>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18059"> <span class="verse-num">43</span>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? <span id="calibre_link-18060" class="verse-num">44</span>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me." <span id="calibre_link-18061" class="verse-num">45</span>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. <span id="calibre_link-18062" class="verse-num">46</span>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. <span id="calibre_link-18063" class="verse-num">47</span>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. <span id="calibre_link-18064" class="verse-num">48</span>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed, <span id="calibre_link-18065" class="verse-num">49</span>and Mizpah, for he said, "The L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> watch between you and me, when we are out of one another's sight. <span id="calibre_link-18066" class="verse-num">50</span>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18067"> <span class="verse-num">51</span>Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me. <span id="calibre_link-18068" class="verse-num">52</span>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. <span id="calibre_link-18069" class="verse-num">53</span>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, <span id="calibre_link-6913" class="verse-num">54</span>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread. They ate bread and spent the night in the hill country.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18070"> <span class="verse-num">55</span> Early in the morning Laban arose and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then Laban departed and returned home.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18071"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the country of Edom, <span id="calibre_link-18072" class="verse-num">4</span>instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, 'I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now. <span id="calibre_link-18073" class="verse-num">5</span>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18074"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him." <span id="calibre_link-18075" class="verse-num">7</span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps, <span id="calibre_link-18076" class="verse-num">8</span>thinking, "If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp that is left will escape."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18077"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your kindred, that I may do you good,' <span id="calibre_link-18078" class="verse-num">10</span>I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps. <span id="calibre_link-18079" class="verse-num">11</span>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, that he may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. <span id="calibre_link-18080" class="verse-num">12</span>But you said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18081"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>So he stayed there that night, and from what he had with him he took a present for his brother Esau, <span id="calibre_link-18082" class="verse-num">14</span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <span id="calibre_link-18083" class="verse-num">15</span>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. <span id="calibre_link-18084" class="verse-num">16</span>These he handed over to his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on ahead of me and put a space between drove and drove." <span id="calibre_link-18085" class="verse-num">17</span>He instructed the first, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, 'To whom do you belong?

They are a present sent to my lord Esau.

For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes ahead of me, and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will accept me." <span id="calibre_link-18089" class="verse-num">21</span>So the present passed on ahead of him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-18090" class="heading">Jacob Wrestles with God</p>

Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18145"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <span id="calibre_link-18146" class="verse-num">6</span>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <span id="calibre_link-18147" class="verse-num">7</span>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother. <span id="calibre_link-18148" class="verse-num">8</span>And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1173"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. <span id="calibre_link-18149" class="verse-num">10</span>And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So he called his name Israel. <span id="calibre_link-9838" class="verse-num">11</span>And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. <span id="calibre_link-18150" class="verse-num">12</span>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you." <span id="calibre_link-18151" class="verse-num">13</span>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. <span id="calibre_link-18152" class="verse-num">14</span>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. <span id="calibre_link-18153" class="verse-num">15</span>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then they journeyed from Bethel.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18205"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>These are the generations of Jacob.</p>
<p class="crossway">Joseph, being seventeen years old, was pasturing the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought a bad report of them to their father. <span id="calibre_link-1365" class="verse-num">3</span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a robe of many colors. <span id="calibre_link-18206" class="verse-num">4</span>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peacefully to him.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-866"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they hated him even more. <span id="calibre_link-18207" class="verse-num">6</span>He said to them, "Hear this dream that I have dreamed: <span id="calibre_link-18208" class="verse-num">7</span>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and stood upright. And behold, your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf." <span id="calibre_link-18209" class="verse-num">8</span>His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to rule over us?" So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18210"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then he dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream. Behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me." <span id="calibre_link-18211" class="verse-num">10</span>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?" <span id="calibre_link-1195" class="verse-num">11</span>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-18212" class="heading">Joseph Sold by His Brothers</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem. <span id="calibre_link-18213" class="verse-num">13</span>And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am." <span id="calibre_link-18214" class="verse-num">14</span>So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring me word." So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <span id="calibre_link-18215" class="verse-num">15</span>And a man found him wandering in the fields. And the man asked him, "What are you seeking?" <span id="calibre_link-18216" class="verse-num">16</span>"I am seeking my brothers," he said. "Tell me, please, where they are pasturing the flock." <span id="calibre_link-18217" class="verse-num">17</span>And the man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18218"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>They saw him from afar, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. <span id="calibre_link-871" class="verse-num">19</span>They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer. <span id="calibre_link-18219" class="verse-num">20</span>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. Then we will say that a fierce animal has devoured him, and we will see what will become of his dreams." <span id="calibre_link-18220" class="verse-num">21</span>But when Reuben heard it, he rescued him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life." <span id="calibre_link-18221" class="verse-num">22</span>And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him"&mdash;that he might rescue him out of their hand to restore him to his father. <span id="calibre_link-18222" class="verse-num">23</span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore. <span id="calibre_link-18223" class="verse-num">24</span>And they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18224"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then they sat down to eat.

And his brothers listened to him. <span id="calibre_link-7612" class="verse-num">28</span>Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. They took Joseph to Egypt.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18227"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes <span id="calibre_link-18228" class="verse-num">30</span>and returned to his brothers and said, "The boy is gone, and I, where shall I go?" <span id="calibre_link-640" class="verse-num">31</span>Then they took Joseph's robe and slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <span id="calibre_link-18229" class="verse-num">32</span>And they sent the robe of many colors and brought it to their father and said, "This we have found; please identify whether it is your son's robe or not." <span id="calibre_link-18230" class="verse-num">33</span>And he identified it and said, "It is my son's robe. A fierce animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces." <span id="calibre_link-6911" class="verse-num">34</span>Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days. <span id="calibre_link-7369" class="verse-num">35</span>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father wept for him. <span id="calibre_link-8458" class="verse-num">36</span>Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18240"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>In the course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died.

She replied, "Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him. <span id="calibre_link-18247" class="verse-num">19</span>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18280"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>And one night they both dreamed&mdash;the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison&mdash;each his own dream, and each dream with its own interpretation. <span id="calibre_link-18281" class="verse-num">6</span>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were troubled. <span id="calibre_link-844" class="verse-num">7</span>So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?" <span id="calibre_link-9148" class="verse-num">8</span>They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them."

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18282"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me, <span id="calibre_link-18283" class="verse-num">10</span>and on the vine there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. <span id="calibre_link-18284" class="verse-num">11</span>Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand." <span id="calibre_link-18285" class="verse-num">12</span>Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <span id="calibre_link-18286" class="verse-num">13</span>In three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his cupbearer. <span id="calibre_link-18287" class="verse-num">14</span>Only remember me, when it is well with you, and please do me the kindness to mention me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house. <span id="calibre_link-18288" class="verse-num">15</span>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the pit."</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18302"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "I remember my offenses today. <span id="calibre_link-18303" class="verse-num">10</span>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <span id="calibre_link-18304" class="verse-num">11</span>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. <span id="calibre_link-18305" class="verse-num">12</span>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18307"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8297"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <span id="calibre_link-18318" class="verse-num">26</span>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. <span id="calibre_link-3809" class="verse-num">27</span>The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. <span id="calibre_link-18319" class="verse-num">28</span>It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <span id="calibre_link-18320" class="verse-num">29</span>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, <span id="calibre_link-12174" class="verse-num">30</span>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <span id="calibre_link-18321" class="verse-num">31</span>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. <span id="calibre_link-18322" class="verse-num">32</span>And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. <span id="calibre_link-18323" class="verse-num">33</span>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <span id="calibre_link-18324" class="verse-num">34</span>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. <span id="calibre_link-10245" class="verse-num">35</span>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <span id="calibre_link-18325" class="verse-num">36</span>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-18326" class="heading">Joseph Rises to Power</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">37</span>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. <span id="calibre_link-18327" class="verse-num">38</span>And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?" <span id="calibre_link-18328" class="verse-num">39</span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. <span id="calibre_link-18329" class="verse-num">40</span>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command. Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you." <span id="calibre_link-18330" class="verse-num">41</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt." <span id="calibre_link-18331" class="verse-num">42</span>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. <span id="calibre_link-18332" class="verse-num">43</span>And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. <span id="calibre_link-18333" class="verse-num">44</span>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." <span id="calibre_link-18334" class="verse-num">45</span>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18335"> <span class="verse-num">46</span>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

He put in every city the food from the fields around it. <span id="calibre_link-1367" class="verse-num">49</span>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18338"> <span class="verse-num">50</span>Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph.

"For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house." <span id="calibre_link-13373" class="verse-num">52</span>The name of the second he called Ephraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18339"> <span class="verse-num">53</span>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, <span id="calibre_link-18340" class="verse-num">54</span>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <span id="calibre_link-18341" class="verse-num">55</span>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18342"> <span class="verse-num">56</span>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <span id="calibre_link-18343" class="verse-num">57</span>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-18347"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land.

Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan. <span id="calibre_link-18580" class="verse-num">12</span>Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them, <span id="calibre_link-18581" class="verse-num">13</span>for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. <span id="calibre_link-18582" class="verse-num">14</span>After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-18583" class="heading">God's Good Purposes</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him." <span id="calibre_link-18584" class="verse-num">16</span>So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died: <span id="calibre_link-18585" class="verse-num">17</span>'Say to Joseph, "Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you."' And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him. <span id="calibre_link-18586" class="verse-num">18</span>His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, "Behold, we are your servants." <span id="calibre_link-18587" class="verse-num">19</span>But Joseph said to them, "Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? <span id="calibre_link-13907" class="verse-num">20</span>As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. <span id="calibre_link-18588" class="verse-num">21</span>So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones." Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-18589" class="heading">The Death of Joseph</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father's house. Joseph lived 110 years. <span id="calibre_link-18590" class="verse-num">23</span>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph's own. <span id="calibre_link-18591" class="verse-num">24</span>And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." <span id="calibre_link-18592" class="verse-num">25</span>Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." <span id="calibre_link-18593" class="verse-num">26</span>So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
