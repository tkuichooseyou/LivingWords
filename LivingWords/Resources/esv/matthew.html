<p class="crossway">And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, <span id="calibre_link-35817" class="verse-num">7</span>and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, <span id="calibre_link-35818" class="verse-num">8</span>and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, <span id="calibre_link-35819" class="verse-num">9</span>and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, <span id="calibre_link-35820" class="verse-num">10</span>and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah, <span id="calibre_link-35821" class="verse-num">11</span>and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8111"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, <span id="calibre_link-35822" class="verse-num">13</span>and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, <span id="calibre_link-35823" class="verse-num">14</span>and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, <span id="calibre_link-35824" class="verse-num">15</span>and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, <span id="calibre_link-35825" class="verse-num">16</span>and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-1371" class="heading">The Birth of Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. <span id="calibre_link-35826" class="verse-num">19</span>And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. <span id="calibre_link-3312" class="verse-num">20</span>But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. <span id="calibre_link-2790" class="verse-num">21</span>She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35827" class="verse-num">22</span>All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1831" class="line-group"> <span class="verse-num">23</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,</p>

<p class="no-indent-line-space">(which means, God with us). <span id="calibre_link-35828" class="verse-num">24</span>When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, <span id="calibre_link-35829" class="verse-num">25</span>but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-35831" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. <span id="calibre_link-35832" class="verse-num">8</span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35833" class="verse-num">9</span>After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. <span id="calibre_link-7767" class="verse-num">10</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. <span id="calibre_link-4436" class="verse-num">11</span>And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. <span id="calibre_link-11534" class="verse-num">12</span>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-869" class="heading">The Flight to Egypt</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35834" class="verse-num">14</span>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt <span id="calibre_link-13294" class="verse-num">15</span>and remained there until the death of Herod.

<p id="calibre_link-12543" class="heading">Herod Kills the Children</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am innocent of this man&acirc;&#128;&#153;s blood; see to it yourselves.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36145" class="verse-num">25</span>And all the people answered, &acirc;&#128;&#156;His blood be on us and on our children!&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36146" class="verse-num">26</span>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-36147" class="heading">Jesus Is Mocked</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. <span id="calibre_link-7097" class="verse-num">28</span>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <span id="calibre_link-4623" class="verse-num">29</span>and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Hail, King of the Jews!&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36148" class="verse-num">30</span>And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. <span id="calibre_link-3611" class="verse-num">31</span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7466" class="heading">The Crucifixion</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. <span id="calibre_link-7541" class="verse-num">33</span>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), <span id="calibre_link-10691" class="verse-num">34</span>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. <span id="calibre_link-2893" class="verse-num">35</span>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. <span id="calibre_link-36149" class="verse-num">36</span>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. <span id="calibre_link-1280" class="verse-num">37</span>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36150" class="verse-num">38</span>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. <span id="calibre_link-36151" class="verse-num">39</span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads <span id="calibre_link-10837" class="verse-num">40</span>and saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36152" class="verse-num">41</span>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, <span id="calibre_link-3578" class="verse-num">42</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <span id="calibre_link-382" class="verse-num">43</span>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him.

<p id="calibre_link-36153" class="heading">The Death of Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">45</span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. <span id="calibre_link-3566" class="verse-num">46</span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</span> that is, <span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</span> <span id="calibre_link-36154" class="verse-num">47</span>And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This man is calling Elijah.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-7675" class="verse-num">48</span>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. <span id="calibre_link-36155" class="verse-num">49</span>But the others said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-1126" class="verse-num">50</span>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3653"> <span class="verse-num">51</span>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.

And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, <span id="calibre_link-10039" class="verse-num">53</span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <span id="calibre_link-7635" class="verse-num">54</span>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Truly this was the Son of God!&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-36156"> <span class="verse-num">55</span>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, <span id="calibre_link-4437" class="verse-num">56</span>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-36157" class="heading">Jesus Is Buried</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">57</span>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-36158" class="verse-num">58</span>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <span id="calibre_link-1373" class="verse-num">59</span>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <span id="calibre_link-7801" class="verse-num">60</span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. <span id="calibre_link-36159" class="verse-num">61</span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-36160" class="heading">The Guard at the Tomb</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">62</span>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate <span id="calibre_link-10838" class="verse-num">63</span>and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, &acirc;&#128;&#152;After three days I will rise.&acirc;&#128;&#153; <span id="calibre_link-15549" class="verse-num">64</span>Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, &acirc;&#128;&#152;He has risen from the dead,&acirc;&#128;&#153; and the last fraud will be worse than the first.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36161" class="verse-num">65</span>Pilate said to them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You have a guard of soldiers.

<p id="calibre_link-36163" class="heading">The Report of the Guard</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. <span id="calibre_link-7617" class="verse-num">12</span>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers <span id="calibre_link-36164" class="verse-num">13</span>and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Tell people, &acirc;&#128;&#152;His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.&acirc;&#128;&#153; <span id="calibre_link-36165" class="verse-num">14</span>And if this comes to the governor&acirc;&#128;&#153;s ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-36166" class="verse-num">15</span>So they took the money and did as they were directed.
