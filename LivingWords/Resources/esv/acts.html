<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, <span id="calibre_link-37628" class="verse-num">2</span>until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. <span id="calibre_link-9832" class="verse-num">3</span>He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8616"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, <span>"you heard from me;</span> <span id="calibre_link-12741" class="verse-num">5</span><span>for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-9189" class="heading">The Ascension</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" <span id="calibre_link-10254" class="verse-num">7</span>He said to them, <span>"It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.</span> <span id="calibre_link-8474" class="verse-num">8</span><span>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."</span> <span id="calibre_link-3167" class="verse-num">9</span>And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. <span id="calibre_link-15570" class="verse-num">10</span>And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, <span id="calibre_link-10670" class="verse-num">11</span>and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8823" class="heading">Matthias Chosen to Replace Judas</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away. <span id="calibre_link-4454" class="verse-num">13</span>And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. <span id="calibre_link-4444" class="verse-num">14</span>All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37629"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said, <span id="calibre_link-37630" class="verse-num">16</span>"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-37631" class="verse-num">17</span>For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry." <span id="calibre_link-37632" class="verse-num">18</span>(Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. <span id="calibre_link-37633" class="verse-num">19</span>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <span id="calibre_link-8691" class="verse-num">20</span>"For it is written in the Book of Psalms,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-1425" class="heading">Peter's Sermon at Pentecost</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. <span id="calibre_link-897" class="verse-num">15</span>For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. <span id="calibre_link-1329" class="verse-num">16</span>But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:</p>

<p class="line-group"> "'The Lord said to my Lord,</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3660"> <span class="verse-num">37</span>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?" <span id="calibre_link-12364" class="verse-num">38</span>And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <span id="calibre_link-2815" class="verse-num">39</span>For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself." <span id="calibre_link-13846" class="verse-num">40</span>And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation." <span id="calibre_link-37647" class="verse-num">41</span>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10022" class="heading">The Fellowship of the Believers</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. <span id="calibre_link-3709" class="verse-num">2</span>And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. <span id="calibre_link-37648" class="verse-num">3</span>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. <span id="calibre_link-37649" class="verse-num">4</span>And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us." <span id="calibre_link-37650" class="verse-num">5</span>And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. <span id="calibre_link-5034" class="verse-num">6</span>But Peter said, "I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37664"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, <span id="calibre_link-9951" class="verse-num">6</span>with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. <span id="calibre_link-37665" class="verse-num">7</span>And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?" <span id="calibre_link-8292" class="verse-num">8</span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders, <span id="calibre_link-3571" class="verse-num">9</span>if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, <span id="calibre_link-37666" class="verse-num">10</span>let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead&mdash;by him this man is standing before you well. <span id="calibre_link-3441" class="verse-num">11</span>This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. <span id="calibre_link-4979" class="verse-num">12</span>And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."</p>

<p class="crossway">Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. <span id="calibre_link-37689" class="verse-num">22</span>But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, <span id="calibre_link-4005" class="verse-num">23</span>"We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside." <span id="calibre_link-37690" class="verse-num">24</span>Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. <span id="calibre_link-37691" class="verse-num">25</span>And someone came and told them, "Look!

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37696"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. <span id="calibre_link-13828" class="verse-num">34</span>But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while. <span id="calibre_link-37697" class="verse-num">35</span>And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men. <span id="calibre_link-735" class="verse-num">36</span>For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him.

So they took his advice, <span id="calibre_link-12803" class="verse-num">40</span>and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <span id="calibre_link-7912" class="verse-num">41</span>Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. <span id="calibre_link-8528" class="verse-num">42</span>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus.</p>

The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, <span id="calibre_link-37706" class="verse-num">3</span>and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.' <span id="calibre_link-37707" class="verse-num">4</span>Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. <span id="calibre_link-37708" class="verse-num">5</span>Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. <span id="calibre_link-37709" class="verse-num">6</span>And God spoke to this effect&mdash;that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. <span id="calibre_link-37710" class="verse-num">7</span>'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.' <span id="calibre_link-37711" class="verse-num">8</span>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37712"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>"And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him <span id="calibre_link-37713" class="verse-num">10</span>and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. <span id="calibre_link-2831" class="verse-num">11</span>Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. <span id="calibre_link-37714" class="verse-num">12</span>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. <span id="calibre_link-37715" class="verse-num">13</span>And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. <span id="calibre_link-37716" class="verse-num">14</span>And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. <span id="calibre_link-37717" class="verse-num">15</span>And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, <span id="calibre_link-37718" class="verse-num">16</span>and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37719"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>"But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt <span id="calibre_link-37720" class="verse-num">18</span>until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. <span id="calibre_link-37721" class="verse-num">19</span>He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. <span id="calibre_link-37722" class="verse-num">20</span>At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight.

And a great many people were added to the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-10687" class="verse-num">25</span>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, <span id="calibre_link-9993" class="verse-num">26</span>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37845"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. <span id="calibre_link-37846" class="verse-num">28</span>And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). <span id="calibre_link-15450" class="verse-num">29</span>So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. <span id="calibre_link-37847" class="verse-num">30</span>And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11426" class="heading">James Killed and Peter Imprisoned</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 12 </span>About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. <span id="calibre_link-1183" class="verse-num">2</span>He killed James the brother of John with the sword, <span id="calibre_link-10118" class="verse-num">3</span>and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. <span id="calibre_link-37848" class="verse-num">4</span>And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. <span id="calibre_link-37849" class="verse-num">5</span>So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7576" class="heading">Peter Is Rescued</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. <span id="calibre_link-2941" class="verse-num">7</span>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands. <span id="calibre_link-37850" class="verse-num">8</span>And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me." <span id="calibre_link-37851" class="verse-num">9</span>And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. <span id="calibre_link-37852" class="verse-num">10</span>When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. <span id="calibre_link-37853" class="verse-num">11</span>When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4410"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. <span id="calibre_link-37854" class="verse-num">13</span>And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. <span id="calibre_link-37855" class="verse-num">14</span>Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. <span id="calibre_link-37856" class="verse-num">15</span>They said to her, "You are out of your mind." But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, "It is his angel!" <span id="calibre_link-37857" class="verse-num">16</span>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. <span id="calibre_link-8588" class="verse-num">17</span>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell these things to James and to the brothers." Then he departed and went to another place.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37858"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. <span id="calibre_link-37859" class="verse-num">19</span>And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37860" class="heading">The Death of Herod</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food. <span id="calibre_link-37861" class="verse-num">21</span>On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them. <span id="calibre_link-37862" class="verse-num">22</span>And the people were shouting, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!" <span id="calibre_link-37863" class="verse-num">23</span>Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4722"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>But the word of God increased and multiplied.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37864"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7464" class="heading">Barnabas and Saul Sent Off</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 13 </span>Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. <span id="calibre_link-10008" class="verse-num">2</span>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." <span id="calibre_link-8516" class="verse-num">3</span>Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37865" class="heading">Barnabas and Saul on Cyprus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. <span id="calibre_link-37866" class="verse-num">5</span>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. <span id="calibre_link-37867" class="verse-num">6</span>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-37868" class="verse-num">7</span>He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. <span id="calibre_link-37869" class="verse-num">8</span>But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. <span id="calibre_link-7053" class="verse-num">9</span>But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him <span id="calibre_link-37870" class="verse-num">10</span>and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? <span id="calibre_link-37871" class="verse-num">11</span>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. <span id="calibre_link-37872" class="verse-num">12</span>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37873" class="heading">Paul and Barnabas at Antioch in Pisidia</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem, <span id="calibre_link-37874" class="verse-num">14</span>but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. <span id="calibre_link-37875" class="verse-num">15</span>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it." <span id="calibre_link-37876" class="verse-num">16</span>So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said:</p>
<p class="crossway">"Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. <span id="calibre_link-37877" class="verse-num">17</span>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. <span id="calibre_link-37878" class="verse-num">18</span>And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <span id="calibre_link-37879" class="verse-num">19</span>And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. <span id="calibre_link-37880" class="verse-num">20</span>All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. <span id="calibre_link-37881" class="verse-num">21</span>Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. <span id="calibre_link-1273" class="verse-num">22</span>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.' <span id="calibre_link-7087" class="verse-num">23</span>Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. <span id="calibre_link-37882" class="verse-num">24</span>Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-37883" class="verse-num">25</span>And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am?

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37884"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>"Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. <span id="calibre_link-37885" class="verse-num">27</span>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. <span id="calibre_link-14012" class="verse-num">28</span>And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. <span id="calibre_link-37886" class="verse-num">29</span>And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. <span id="calibre_link-219" class="verse-num">30</span>But God raised him from the dead, <span id="calibre_link-37887" class="verse-num">31</span>and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. <span id="calibre_link-37888" class="verse-num">32</span>And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, <span id="calibre_link-12831" class="verse-num">33</span>this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,</p>
<p class="line-group"> "'You are my Son,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-37889" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">34</span>And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-37890" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">35</span>Therefore he says also in another psalm,</p>
<p class="line-group"> "'You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37891" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, <span id="calibre_link-37892" class="verse-num">37</span>but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. <span id="calibre_link-37893" class="verse-num">38</span>Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, <span id="calibre_link-12383" class="verse-num">39</span>and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. <span id="calibre_link-37894" class="verse-num">40</span>Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:</p>

<p id="calibre_link-37896" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">42</span>As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. <span id="calibre_link-1420" class="verse-num">43</span>And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37897" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">44</span>The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-37898" class="verse-num">45</span>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. <span id="calibre_link-5055" class="verse-num">46</span>And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you.

<p class="line-group"> "'I have made you a light for the Gentiles,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-10063" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">48</span>And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. <span id="calibre_link-37899" class="verse-num">49</span>And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. <span id="calibre_link-37900" class="verse-num">50</span>But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. <span id="calibre_link-923" class="verse-num">51</span>But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. <span id="calibre_link-37901" class="verse-num">52</span>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 14 </span>Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed. <span id="calibre_link-16973" class="verse-num">2</span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. <span id="calibre_link-37902" class="verse-num">3</span>So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <span id="calibre_link-37903" class="verse-num">4</span>But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles. <span id="calibre_link-4615" class="verse-num">5</span>When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, <span id="calibre_link-37904" class="verse-num">6</span>they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country, <span id="calibre_link-13949" class="verse-num">7</span>and there they continued to preach the gospel.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37905" class="heading">Paul and Barnabas at Lystra</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet.

And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, <span id="calibre_link-37907" class="verse-num">10</span>said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he sprang up and began walking. <span id="calibre_link-37908" class="verse-num">11</span>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!" <span id="calibre_link-8112" class="verse-num">12</span>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. <span id="calibre_link-37909" class="verse-num">13</span>And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. <span id="calibre_link-37910" class="verse-num">14</span>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, <span id="calibre_link-37911" class="verse-num">15</span>"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. <span id="calibre_link-37912" class="verse-num">16</span>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. <span id="calibre_link-12402" class="verse-num">17</span>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness." <span id="calibre_link-37913" class="verse-num">18</span>Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8198" class="heading">Paul Stoned at Lystra</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. <span id="calibre_link-37914" class="verse-num">20</span>But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. <span id="calibre_link-37915" class="verse-num">21</span>When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, <span id="calibre_link-37916" class="verse-num">22</span>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. <span id="calibre_link-13296" class="verse-num">23</span>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-37927" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, <span id="calibre_link-8432" class="verse-num">20</span>but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. <span id="calibre_link-9905" class="verse-num">21</span>For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7447" class="heading">The Council's Letter to Gentile Believers</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, <span id="calibre_link-7984" class="verse-num">23</span>with the following letter: "The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. <span id="calibre_link-37928" class="verse-num">24</span>Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, <span id="calibre_link-37929" class="verse-num">25</span>it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, <span id="calibre_link-37930" class="verse-num">26</span>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-37931" class="verse-num">27</span>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. <span id="calibre_link-13095" class="verse-num">28</span>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: <span id="calibre_link-37932" class="verse-num">29</span>that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3357"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. <span id="calibre_link-37933" class="verse-num">31</span>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. <span id="calibre_link-37934" class="verse-num">32</span>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. <span id="calibre_link-37935" class="verse-num">33</span>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. <span id="calibre_link-8529" class="verse-num">35</span>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37936" class="heading">Paul and Barnabas Separate</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are." <span id="calibre_link-1338" class="verse-num">37</span>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. <span id="calibre_link-37937" class="verse-num">38</span>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. <span id="calibre_link-4411" class="verse-num">39</span>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, <span id="calibre_link-37938" class="verse-num">40</span>but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-37939" class="verse-num">41</span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 16 </span>Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. <span id="calibre_link-37940" class="verse-num">2</span>He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. <span id="calibre_link-37941" class="verse-num">3</span>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <span id="calibre_link-37942" class="verse-num">4</span>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-3071" class="verse-num">5</span>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10176" class="heading">The Macedonian Call</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. <span id="calibre_link-37943" class="verse-num">7</span>And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. <span id="calibre_link-10989" class="verse-num">8</span>So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. <span id="calibre_link-1843" class="verse-num">9</span>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." <span id="calibre_link-37944" class="verse-num">10</span>And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37945" class="heading">The Conversion of Lydia</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, <span id="calibre_link-8309" class="verse-num">12</span>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. <span id="calibre_link-37946" class="verse-num">13</span>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. <span id="calibre_link-8714" class="verse-num">14</span>One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. <span id="calibre_link-37947" class="verse-num">15</span>And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-778" class="heading">Paul and Silas in Prison</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. <span id="calibre_link-37948" class="verse-num">17</span>She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation." <span id="calibre_link-37949" class="verse-num">18</span>And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37950"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. <span id="calibre_link-37951" class="verse-num">20</span>And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. <span id="calibre_link-37952" class="verse-num">21</span>They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice." <span id="calibre_link-37953" class="verse-num">22</span>The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. <span id="calibre_link-37954" class="verse-num">23</span>And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. <span id="calibre_link-37955" class="verse-num">24</span>Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4549" class="heading">The Philippian Jailer Converted</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, <span id="calibre_link-13271" class="verse-num">26</span>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened. <span id="calibre_link-8593" class="verse-num">27</span>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. <span id="calibre_link-37956" class="verse-num">28</span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here." <span id="calibre_link-37957" class="verse-num">29</span>And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. <span id="calibre_link-7069" class="verse-num">30</span>Then he brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" <span id="calibre_link-12858" class="verse-num">31</span>And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household." <span id="calibre_link-37958" class="verse-num">32</span>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. <span id="calibre_link-12173" class="verse-num">33</span>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. <span id="calibre_link-37959" class="verse-num">34</span>Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37960"> <span class="verse-num">35</span>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, "Let those men go." <span id="calibre_link-37961" class="verse-num">36</span>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace." <span id="calibre_link-37962" class="verse-num">37</span>But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out." <span id="calibre_link-37963" class="verse-num">38</span>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. <span id="calibre_link-37964" class="verse-num">39</span>So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. <span id="calibre_link-37965" class="verse-num">40</span>So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 17 </span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-7140" class="verse-num">2</span>And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <span id="calibre_link-220" class="verse-num">3</span>explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ." <span id="calibre_link-8277" class="verse-num">4</span>And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. <span id="calibre_link-37966" class="verse-num">5</span>But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd. <span id="calibre_link-37967" class="verse-num">6</span>And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, <span id="calibre_link-37968" class="verse-num">7</span>and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus." <span id="calibre_link-37969" class="verse-num">8</span>And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things. <span id="calibre_link-37970" class="verse-num">9</span>And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12884" class="heading">Paul and Silas in Berea</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. <span id="calibre_link-105" class="verse-num">11</span>Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. <span id="calibre_link-37971" class="verse-num">12</span>Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. <span id="calibre_link-37972" class="verse-num">13</span>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds. <span id="calibre_link-37973" class="verse-num">14</span>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. <span id="calibre_link-37974" class="verse-num">15</span>Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9023" class="heading">Paul in Athens</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. <span id="calibre_link-37975" class="verse-num">17</span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. <span id="calibre_link-8315" class="verse-num">18</span>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, "What does this babbler wish to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities"&mdash;because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. <span id="calibre_link-37976" class="verse-num">19</span>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <span id="calibre_link-7816" class="verse-num">20</span>For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean." <span id="calibre_link-37977" class="verse-num">21</span>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10079" class="heading">Paul Addresses the Areopagus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. <span id="calibre_link-9863" class="verse-num">23</span>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. <span id="calibre_link-3979" class="verse-num">24</span>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, <span id="calibre_link-13055" class="verse-num">25</span>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. <span id="calibre_link-546" class="verse-num">26</span>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, <span id="calibre_link-37978" class="verse-num">27</span>that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, <span id="calibre_link-3980" class="verse-num">28</span>for</p>
<p class="line-group"> "'In him we live and move and have our being';</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">as even some of your own poets have said,</p>
<p class="line-group"> "'For we are indeed his offspring.'</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37980"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, "We will hear you again about this." <span id="calibre_link-37981" class="verse-num">33</span>So Paul went out from their midst. <span id="calibre_link-37982" class="verse-num">34</span>But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7448"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-13861" class="verse-num">6</span>And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads!

His house was next door to the synagogue. <span id="calibre_link-37985" class="verse-num">8</span>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, <span id="calibre_link-7734" class="verse-num">12</span>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. <span id="calibre_link-38005" class="verse-num">13</span>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims." <span id="calibre_link-38006" class="verse-num">14</span>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. <span id="calibre_link-38007" class="verse-num">15</span>But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?" <span id="calibre_link-38008" class="verse-num">16</span>And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <span id="calibre_link-38009" class="verse-num">17</span>And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks.

<p id="calibre_link-38012" class="heading">A Riot at Ephesus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome." <span id="calibre_link-38013" class="verse-num">22</span>And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38014"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. <span id="calibre_link-38015" class="verse-num">24</span>For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. <span id="calibre_link-38016" class="verse-num">25</span>These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, "Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. <span id="calibre_link-13935" class="verse-num">26</span>And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. <span id="calibre_link-13931" class="verse-num">27</span>And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10141"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!" <span id="calibre_link-38017" class="verse-num">29</span>So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel. <span id="calibre_link-38018" class="verse-num">30</span>But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. <span id="calibre_link-38019" class="verse-num">31</span>And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. <span id="calibre_link-38020" class="verse-num">32</span>Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. <span id="calibre_link-9827" class="verse-num">33</span>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. <span id="calibre_link-38021" class="verse-num">34</span>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38022"> <span class="verse-num">35</span>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? <span id="calibre_link-15378" class="verse-num">36</span>Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. <span id="calibre_link-38023" class="verse-num">37</span>For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. <span id="calibre_link-38024" class="verse-num">38</span>If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. <span id="calibre_link-38025" class="verse-num">39</span>But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. <span id="calibre_link-38026" class="verse-num">40</span>For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion." <span id="calibre_link-38027" class="verse-num">41</span>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p>

Paul said, "But I am a citizen by birth." <span id="calibre_link-38102" class="verse-num">29</span>So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38103" class="heading">Paul Before the Council</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3454"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 23 </span>And looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day." <span id="calibre_link-9900" class="verse-num">2</span>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. <span id="calibre_link-38104" class="verse-num">3</span>Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?" <span id="calibre_link-38105" class="verse-num">4</span>Those who stood by said, "Would you revile God's high priest?" <span id="calibre_link-38106" class="verse-num">5</span>And Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8303"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial." <span id="calibre_link-747" class="verse-num">7</span>And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. <span id="calibre_link-38107" class="verse-num">8</span>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. <span id="calibre_link-7130" class="verse-num">9</span>Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?" <span id="calibre_link-38108" class="verse-num">10</span>And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3479"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>The following night the Lord stood by him and said, <span>"Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-38109" class="heading">A Plot to Kill Paul</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. <span id="calibre_link-38110" class="verse-num">13</span>There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. <span id="calibre_link-38111" class="verse-num">14</span>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. <span id="calibre_link-38112" class="verse-num">15</span>Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9882"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. <span id="calibre_link-38113" class="verse-num">17</span>Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him." <span id="calibre_link-38114" class="verse-num">18</span>So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you." <span id="calibre_link-38115" class="verse-num">19</span>The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?" <span id="calibre_link-38116" class="verse-num">20</span>And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. <span id="calibre_link-38117" class="verse-num">21</span>But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him.

<p id="calibre_link-38119" class="heading">Paul Sent to Felix the Governor</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>Then he called two of the centurions and said, "Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. <span id="calibre_link-38120" class="verse-num">24</span>Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor." <span id="calibre_link-38121" class="verse-num">25</span>And he wrote a letter to this effect:</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38127"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. <span id="calibre_link-38128" class="verse-num">32</span>And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. <span id="calibre_link-38129" class="verse-num">33</span>When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. <span id="calibre_link-38130" class="verse-num">34</span>On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from.

<p class="crossway">"Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, <span id="calibre_link-38132" class="verse-num">3</span>in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. <span id="calibre_link-38133" class="verse-num">4</span>But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. <span id="calibre_link-38134" class="verse-num">5</span>For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <span id="calibre_link-38135" class="verse-num">6</span>He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. <span id="calibre_link-38136" class="verse-num">8</span>By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38137"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38138"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied:</p>
<p class="crossway">"Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. <span id="calibre_link-38139" class="verse-num">11</span>You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, <span id="calibre_link-38140" class="verse-num">12</span>and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. <span id="calibre_link-38141" class="verse-num">13</span>Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. <span id="calibre_link-38142" class="verse-num">14</span>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, <span id="calibre_link-15497" class="verse-num">15</span>having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. <span id="calibre_link-3132" class="verse-num">16</span>So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man. <span id="calibre_link-38143" class="verse-num">17</span>Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. <span id="calibre_link-38144" class="verse-num">18</span>While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult.

<p id="calibre_link-38148" class="heading">Paul Kept in Custody</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case." <span id="calibre_link-38149" class="verse-num">23</span>Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38150"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-38151" class="verse-num">25</span>And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, "Go away for the present.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 25 </span>Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. <span id="calibre_link-38153" class="verse-num">2</span>And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him, <span id="calibre_link-9883" class="verse-num">3</span>asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem&mdash;because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way. <span id="calibre_link-38154" class="verse-num">4</span>Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. <span id="calibre_link-38155" class="verse-num">5</span>"So," said he, "let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38156"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea.

<p id="calibre_link-9802" class="heading">Paul Before Agrippa and Bernice</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. <span id="calibre_link-38162" class="verse-num">14</span>And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man left prisoner by Felix, <span id="calibre_link-38163" class="verse-num">15</span>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. <span id="calibre_link-38164" class="verse-num">16</span>I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. <span id="calibre_link-38165" class="verse-num">17</span>So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. <span id="calibre_link-38166" class="verse-num">18</span>When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. <span id="calibre_link-38167" class="verse-num">19</span>Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. <span id="calibre_link-38168" class="verse-num">20</span>Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. <span id="calibre_link-13315" class="verse-num">21</span>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar." <span id="calibre_link-38169" class="verse-num">22</span>Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," said he, "you will hear him."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38170"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city.

And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him. <span id="calibre_link-38173" class="verse-num">26</span>But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. <span id="calibre_link-38174" class="verse-num">27</span>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him."</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 26 </span>So Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38175"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>"I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, <span id="calibre_link-38176" class="verse-num">3</span>especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38177"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>"My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-38178" class="verse-num">5</span>They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. <span id="calibre_link-38179" class="verse-num">6</span>And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, <span id="calibre_link-9705" class="verse-num">7</span>to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! <span id="calibre_link-38180" class="verse-num">8</span>Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38181"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>"I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. <span id="calibre_link-6943" class="verse-num">10</span>And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. <span id="calibre_link-12946" class="verse-num">11</span>And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38182" class="heading">Paul Tells of His Conversion</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>"In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. <span id="calibre_link-13068" class="verse-num">13</span>At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me. <span id="calibre_link-38183" class="verse-num">14</span>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, <span>'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</span> <span id="calibre_link-38184" class="verse-num">15</span>And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, <span>'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span id="calibre_link-10059" class="verse-num">16</span><span>But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,</span> <span id="calibre_link-38185" class="verse-num">17</span><span>delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles&mdash;to whom I am sending you</span> <span id="calibre_link-7000" class="verse-num">18</span><span>to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</span></p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1844"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>"Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <span id="calibre_link-336" class="verse-num">20</span>but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. <span id="calibre_link-38186" class="verse-num">21</span>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. <span id="calibre_link-38187" class="verse-num">22</span>To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: <span id="calibre_link-38188" class="verse-num">23</span>that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38189"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind." <span id="calibre_link-38190" class="verse-num">25</span>But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. <span id="calibre_link-38191" class="verse-num">26</span>For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. <span id="calibre_link-38192" class="verse-num">27</span>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe." <span id="calibre_link-3056" class="verse-num">28</span>And Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?" <span id="calibre_link-38193" class="verse-num">29</span>And Paul said, "Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am&mdash;except for these chains."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38194"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. <span id="calibre_link-38195" class="verse-num">31</span>And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment." <span id="calibre_link-38196" class="verse-num">32</span>And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38204"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, <span id="calibre_link-38205" class="verse-num">10</span>saying, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives." <span id="calibre_link-38206" class="verse-num">11</span>But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. <span id="calibre_link-38207" class="verse-num">12</span>And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38208" class="heading">The Storm at Sea</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. <span id="calibre_link-38209" class="verse-num">14</span>But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. <span id="calibre_link-38210" class="verse-num">15</span>And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. <span id="calibre_link-38211" class="verse-num">16</span>Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat. <span id="calibre_link-38212" class="verse-num">17</span>After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. <span id="calibre_link-38213" class="verse-num">18</span>Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. <span id="calibre_link-38214" class="verse-num">19</span>And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. <span id="calibre_link-10726" class="verse-num">20</span>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38215"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. <span id="calibre_link-38216" class="verse-num">22</span>Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. <span id="calibre_link-9918" class="verse-num">23</span>For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, <span id="calibre_link-38217" class="verse-num">24</span>and he said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.' <span id="calibre_link-38218" class="verse-num">25</span>So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. <span id="calibre_link-38219" class="verse-num">26</span>But we must run aground on some island."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38220"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. <span id="calibre_link-38221" class="verse-num">28</span>So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. <span id="calibre_link-38222" class="verse-num">29</span>And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. <span id="calibre_link-38223" class="verse-num">30</span>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, <span id="calibre_link-38224" class="verse-num">31</span>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved." <span id="calibre_link-38225" class="verse-num">32</span>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38226"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. <span id="calibre_link-38227" class="verse-num">34</span>Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you." <span id="calibre_link-38228" class="verse-num">35</span>And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. <span id="calibre_link-38229" class="verse-num">36</span>Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. <span id="calibre_link-38230" class="verse-num">37</span>(We were in all 276 persons in the ship.) <span id="calibre_link-38231" class="verse-num">38</span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38232" class="heading">The Shipwreck</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">39</span>Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. <span id="calibre_link-38233" class="verse-num">40</span>So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. <span id="calibre_link-38234" class="verse-num">41</span>But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. <span id="calibre_link-38235" class="verse-num">42</span>The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape. <span id="calibre_link-2930" class="verse-num">43</span>But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, <span id="calibre_link-38236" class="verse-num">44</span>and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11438" class="heading">Paul on Malta</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1">ACTS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 28 </span>After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta. <span id="calibre_link-38237" class="verse-num">2</span>The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold. <span id="calibre_link-1827" class="verse-num">3</span>When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. <span id="calibre_link-38238" class="verse-num">4</span>When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live." <span id="calibre_link-38239" class="verse-num">5</span>He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. <span id="calibre_link-38240" class="verse-num">6</span>They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13358"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. <span id="calibre_link-38241" class="verse-num">8</span>It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. <span id="calibre_link-3638" class="verse-num">9</span>And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. <span id="calibre_link-38242" class="verse-num">10</span>They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38243" class="heading">Paul Arrives at Rome</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead. <span id="calibre_link-38244" class="verse-num">12</span>Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. <span id="calibre_link-38245" class="verse-num">13</span>And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. <span id="calibre_link-38246" class="verse-num">14</span>There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. <span id="calibre_link-38247" class="verse-num">15</span>And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage. <span id="calibre_link-15582" class="verse-num">16</span>And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38248" class="heading">Paul in Rome</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. <span id="calibre_link-38249" class="verse-num">18</span>When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. <span id="calibre_link-10026" class="verse-num">19</span>But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar&mdash;though I had no charge to bring against my nation. <span id="calibre_link-2939" class="verse-num">20</span>For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain." <span id="calibre_link-38250" class="verse-num">21</span>And they said to him, "We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. <span id="calibre_link-38251" class="verse-num">22</span>But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10782"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. <span id="calibre_link-654" class="verse-num">24</span>And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved. <span id="calibre_link-38252" class="verse-num">25</span>And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38253" class="line-group"> <span class="verse-num">26</span> "'Go to this people, and say,</p>

<p class="line-indent">and you will indeed see but never perceive."</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-15814" class="verse-num">27</span> For this people's heart has grown dull,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-3963" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38254"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, <span id="calibre_link-13016" class="verse-num">31</span>proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.</p>
