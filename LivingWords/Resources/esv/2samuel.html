<p id="calibre_link-12416" class="heading">David Hears of Saul's Death</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. <span id="calibre_link-24157" class="verse-num">2</span>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. <span id="calibre_link-24158" class="verse-num">3</span>David said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel." <span id="calibre_link-24159" class="verse-num">4</span>And David said to him, "How did it go? Tell me." And he answered, "The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead." <span id="calibre_link-24160" class="verse-num">5</span>Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?" <span id="calibre_link-24161" class="verse-num">6</span>And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. <span id="calibre_link-24162" class="verse-num">7</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, 'Here I am.' <span id="calibre_link-24163" class="verse-num">8</span>And he said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.' <span id="calibre_link-24164" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to me, 'Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.' <span id="calibre_link-24165" class="verse-num">10</span>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24166"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. <span id="calibre_link-24167" class="verse-num">12</span>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <span id="calibre_link-24168" class="verse-num">13</span>And David said to the young man who told him, "Where do you come from?" And he answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite." <span id="calibre_link-24169" class="verse-num">14</span>David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?" <span id="calibre_link-24170" class="verse-num">15</span>Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, execute him." And he struck him down so that he died. <span id="calibre_link-24171" class="verse-num">16</span>And David said to him, "Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, 'I have killed the LORD's anointed.'"</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>After this David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." David said, "To which shall I go up?" And he said, "To Hebron." <span id="calibre_link-24181" class="verse-num">2</span>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. <span id="calibre_link-24182" class="verse-num">3</span>And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron. <span id="calibre_link-165" class="verse-num">4</span>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="crossway">When they told David, "It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul," <span id="calibre_link-24183" class="verse-num">5</span>David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, "May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him. <span id="calibre_link-24184" class="verse-num">6</span>Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing. <span id="calibre_link-24185" class="verse-num">7</span>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24186" class="heading">Ish-bosheth Made King of Israel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim, <span id="calibre_link-24187" class="verse-num">9</span>and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. <span id="calibre_link-1414" class="verse-num">10</span>Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. <span id="calibre_link-15845" class="verse-num">11</span>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24188" class="heading">The Battle of Gibeon</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <span id="calibre_link-24189" class="verse-num">13</span>And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <span id="calibre_link-24190" class="verse-num">14</span>And Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men arise and compete before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise." <span id="calibre_link-24191" class="verse-num">15</span>Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <span id="calibre_link-24192" class="verse-num">16</span>And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent's side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is at Gibeon. <span id="calibre_link-24193" class="verse-num">17</span>And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24194"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. <span id="calibre_link-10144" class="verse-num">19</span>And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <span id="calibre_link-24195" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is it you, Asahel?" And he answered, "It is I." <span id="calibre_link-24196" class="verse-num">21</span>Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil." But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <span id="calibre_link-24197" class="verse-num">22</span>And Abner said again to Asahel, "Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?" <span id="calibre_link-24198" class="verse-num">23</span>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1320"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. <span id="calibre_link-24199" class="verse-num">25</span>And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. <span id="calibre_link-575" class="verse-num">26</span>Then Abner called to Joab, "Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?" <span id="calibre_link-24200" class="verse-num">27</span>And Joab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning." <span id="calibre_link-24201" class="verse-num">28</span>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24202"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. <span id="calibre_link-24203" class="verse-num">30</span>Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <span id="calibre_link-24204" class="verse-num">31</span>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner's men. <span id="calibre_link-24205" class="verse-num">32</span>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12418" class="heading">Abner Joins David</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. And David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9891"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>And sons were born to David at Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel; <span id="calibre_link-24206" class="verse-num">3</span>and his second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <span id="calibre_link-24207" class="verse-num">4</span>and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <span id="calibre_link-24208" class="verse-num">5</span>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9622"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul. <span id="calibre_link-24209" class="verse-num">7</span>Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ish-bosheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?" <span id="calibre_link-24210" class="verse-num">8</span>Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head of Judah? To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David. And yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman. <span id="calibre_link-24211" class="verse-num">9</span>God do so to Abner and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him, <span id="calibre_link-12820" class="verse-num">10</span>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba." <span id="calibre_link-24212" class="verse-num">11</span>And Ish-bosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24213"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you." <span id="calibre_link-24214" class="verse-num">13</span>And he said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face." <span id="calibre_link-24215" class="verse-num">14</span>Then David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bridal price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines." <span id="calibre_link-24216" class="verse-num">15</span>And Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband Paltiel the son of Laish. <span id="calibre_link-24217" class="verse-num">16</span>But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return." And he returned.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24218"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you. <span id="calibre_link-24219" class="verse-num">18</span>Now then bring it about, for the LORD has promised David, saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'" <span id="calibre_link-24220" class="verse-num">19</span>Abner also spoke to Benjamin. And then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24221"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him. <span id="calibre_link-24222" class="verse-num">21</span>And Abner said to David, "I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24223"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Just then the servants of David arrived with Joab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. <span id="calibre_link-24224" class="verse-num">23</span>When Joab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Joab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace." <span id="calibre_link-24225" class="verse-num">24</span>Then Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone? <span id="calibre_link-24226" class="verse-num">25</span>You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24227" class="heading">Joab Murders Abner</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>When Joab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know about it. <span id="calibre_link-24228" class="verse-num">27</span>And when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the stomach, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. <span id="calibre_link-24229" class="verse-num">28</span>Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. <span id="calibre_link-24230" class="verse-num">29</span>May it fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house, and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge or who is leprous or who holds a spindle or who falls by the sword or who lacks bread!" <span id="calibre_link-9609" class="verse-num">30</span>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-24231" class="heading">David Mourns Abner</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn before Abner." And King David followed the bier. <span id="calibre_link-24232" class="verse-num">32</span>They buried Abner at Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. <span id="calibre_link-9623" class="verse-num">33</span>And the king lamented for Abner, saying,</p>
<p class="line-group"> "Should Abner die as a fool dies?</p>

<p class="no-indent-line-space">And all the people wept again over him. <span id="calibre_link-24234" class="verse-num">35</span>Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day.

These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I. The LORD repay the evildoer according to his wickedness!"</p>

<p id="calibre_link-12425" class="heading">David and Bathsheba</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 11 </span>In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24354"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. <span id="calibre_link-24355" class="verse-num">3</span>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?" <span id="calibre_link-24356" class="verse-num">4</span>So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. <span id="calibre_link-24357" class="verse-num">5</span>And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, "I am pregnant."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24358"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>So David sent word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David. <span id="calibre_link-24359" class="verse-num">7</span>When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going. <span id="calibre_link-24360" class="verse-num">8</span>Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king. <span id="calibre_link-24361" class="verse-num">9</span>But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. <span id="calibre_link-24362" class="verse-num">10</span>When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?" <span id="calibre_link-17013" class="verse-num">11</span>Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing." <span id="calibre_link-24363" class="verse-num">12</span>Then David said to Uriah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. <span id="calibre_link-24364" class="verse-num">13</span>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24365"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. <span id="calibre_link-24366" class="verse-num">15</span>In the letter he wrote, "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die." <span id="calibre_link-24367" class="verse-num">16</span>And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men. <span id="calibre_link-24368" class="verse-num">17</span>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died. <span id="calibre_link-24369" class="verse-num">18</span>Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting. <span id="calibre_link-24370" class="verse-num">19</span>And he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king, <span id="calibre_link-24371" class="verse-num">20</span>then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? <span id="calibre_link-24372" class="verse-num">21</span>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24373"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell. <span id="calibre_link-24374" class="verse-num">23</span>The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. <span id="calibre_link-24375" class="verse-num">24</span>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also." <span id="calibre_link-24376" class="verse-num">25</span>David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.' And encourage him."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24377"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband. <span id="calibre_link-740" class="verse-num">27</span>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12426" class="heading">Nathan Rebukes David</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 12 </span>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. <span id="calibre_link-24378" class="verse-num">2</span>The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <span id="calibre_link-24379" class="verse-num">3</span>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. <span id="calibre_link-3695" class="verse-num">4</span>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him." <span id="calibre_link-24380" class="verse-num">5</span>Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die, <span id="calibre_link-24381" class="verse-num">6</span>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-5002"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Nathan said to David, "You are the man!

And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. <span id="calibre_link-24383" class="verse-num">9</span>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. <span id="calibre_link-24384" class="verse-num">10</span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.' <span id="calibre_link-24385" class="verse-num">11</span>Thus says the LORD, 'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. <span id="calibre_link-24386" class="verse-num">12</span>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.'" <span id="calibre_link-166" class="verse-num">13</span>David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. <span id="calibre_link-7122" class="verse-num">14</span>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die." <span id="calibre_link-24387" class="verse-num">15</span>Then Nathan went to his house.</p>
<p class="heading">David's Child Dies</p>
<p class="calibre9"> And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he became sick. <span id="calibre_link-24388" class="verse-num">16</span>David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. <span id="calibre_link-24389" class="verse-num">17</span>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. <span id="calibre_link-24390" class="verse-num">18</span>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm." <span id="calibre_link-24391" class="verse-num">19</span>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead." <span id="calibre_link-24392" class="verse-num">20</span>Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. <span id="calibre_link-24393" class="verse-num">21</span>Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food." <span id="calibre_link-24394" class="verse-num">22</span>He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, 'Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' <span id="calibre_link-24395" class="verse-num">23</span>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7621" class="heading">Solomon's Birth</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him <span id="calibre_link-24396" class="verse-num">25</span>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9889" class="heading">Rabbah Is Captured</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city. <span id="calibre_link-24397" class="verse-num">27</span>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, "I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. <span id="calibre_link-24398" class="verse-num">28</span>Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name." <span id="calibre_link-24399" class="verse-num">29</span>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it. <span id="calibre_link-24400" class="verse-num">30</span>And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <span id="calibre_link-24401" class="verse-num">31</span>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns.

<p id="calibre_link-9651" class="heading">Amnon and Tamar</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 13 </span>Now Absalom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar. And after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her. <span id="calibre_link-24402" class="verse-num">2</span>And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her. <span id="calibre_link-24403" class="verse-num">3</span>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother. And Jonadab was a very crafty man. <span id="calibre_link-24404" class="verse-num">4</span>And he said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister." <span id="calibre_link-24405" class="verse-num">5</span>Jonadab said to him, "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.'" <span id="calibre_link-24406" class="verse-num">6</span>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. And when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24407"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him." <span id="calibre_link-24408" class="verse-num">8</span>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes. <span id="calibre_link-24409" class="verse-num">9</span>And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Send out everyone from me." So everyone went out from him. <span id="calibre_link-24410" class="verse-num">10</span>Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. <span id="calibre_link-24411" class="verse-num">11</span>But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister." <span id="calibre_link-24412" class="verse-num">12</span>She answered him, "No, my brother, do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this outrageous thing. <span id="calibre_link-24413" class="verse-num">13</span>As for me, where could I carry my shame?

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24415"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Get up! Go!" <span id="calibre_link-24416" class="verse-num">16</span>But she said to him, "No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me." But he would not listen to her. <span id="calibre_link-24417" class="verse-num">17</span>He called the young man who served him and said, "Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her." <span id="calibre_link-24418" class="verse-num">18</span>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. <span id="calibre_link-24419" class="verse-num">19</span>And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore. And she laid her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10680"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>And her brother Absalom said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister.

So Tamar lived, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house. <span id="calibre_link-24420" class="verse-num">21</span>When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. <span id="calibre_link-24421" class="verse-num">22</span>But Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad, for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had violated his sister Tamar.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>After two full years Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king's sons. <span id="calibre_link-24423" class="verse-num">24</span>And Absalom came to the king and said, "Behold, your servant has sheepshearers.

And the woman said, "Let my lord the king speak." <span id="calibre_link-24456" class="verse-num">19</span>The king said, "Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Joab who commanded me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant. <span id="calibre_link-24457" class="verse-num">20</span>In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24458"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Then the king said to Joab, "Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Absalom." <span id="calibre_link-24459" class="verse-num">22</span>And Joab fell on his face to the ground and paid homage and blessed the king. And Joab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant." <span id="calibre_link-24460" class="verse-num">23</span>So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-24461" class="verse-num">24</span>And the king said, "Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Absalom lived apart in his own house and did not come into the king's presence.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24462"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <span id="calibre_link-24463" class="verse-num">26</span>And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight. <span id="calibre_link-24464" class="verse-num">27</span>There were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24465"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>So Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence. <span id="calibre_link-24466" class="verse-num">29</span>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but Joab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Joab would not come. <span id="calibre_link-24467" class="verse-num">30</span>Then he said to his servants, "See, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire. <span id="calibre_link-24468" class="verse-num">31</span>Then Joab arose and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?" <span id="calibre_link-24469" class="verse-num">32</span>Absalom answered Joab, "Behold, I sent word to you, 'Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still." Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.'" <span id="calibre_link-24470" class="verse-num">33</span>Then Joab went to the king and told him, and he summoned Absalom. So he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king, and the king kissed Absalom.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1972">2 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 15 </span>After this Absalom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him. <span id="calibre_link-24471" class="verse-num">2</span>And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate. And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, "From what city are you?" And when he said, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel," <span id="calibre_link-24472" class="verse-num">3</span>Absalom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you." <span id="calibre_link-24473" class="verse-num">4</span>Then Absalom would say, "Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice." <span id="calibre_link-24474" class="verse-num">5</span>And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. <span id="calibre_link-9652" class="verse-num">6</span>Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24475"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>And at the end of four years Absalom said to the king, "Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron. <span id="calibre_link-24476" class="verse-num">8</span>For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram, saying, 'If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.'" <span id="calibre_link-24477" class="verse-num">9</span>The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose and went to Hebron. <span id="calibre_link-24478" class="verse-num">10</span>But Absalom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, 'Absalom is king at Hebron!'" <span id="calibre_link-24479" class="verse-num">11</span>With Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their innocence and knew nothing. <span id="calibre_link-9814" class="verse-num">12</span>And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh.

<p id="calibre_link-24480" class="heading">David Flees Jerusalem</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>And a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom." <span id="calibre_link-24481" class="verse-num">14</span>Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee, or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom. Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly and bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword." <span id="calibre_link-24482" class="verse-num">15</span>And the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides." <span id="calibre_link-24483" class="verse-num">16</span>So the king went out, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house. <span id="calibre_link-24484" class="verse-num">17</span>And the king went out, and all the people after him.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24485"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And all his servants passed by him, and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king. <span id="calibre_link-24486" class="verse-num">19</span>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home. <span id="calibre_link-24487" class="verse-num">20</span>You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, since I go I know not where? Go back and take your brothers with you, and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you." <span id="calibre_link-24488" class="verse-num">21</span>But Ittai answered the king, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be." <span id="calibre_link-24489" class="verse-num">22</span>And David said to Ittai, "Go then, pass on." So Ittai the Gittite passed on with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. <span id="calibre_link-24490" class="verse-num">23</span>And all the land wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24491"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>And Abiathar came up, and behold, Zadok came also with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God.

If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place. <span id="calibre_link-24493" class="verse-num">26</span>But if he says, 'I have no pleasure in you,' behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him." <span id="calibre_link-8081" class="verse-num">27</span>The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Are you not a seer?

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24495"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24497"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>While David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and dirt on his head. <span id="calibre_link-24498" class="verse-num">33</span>David said to him, "If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. <span id="calibre_link-24499" class="verse-num">34</span>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel. <span id="calibre_link-24500" class="verse-num">35</span>Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there?

I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt." <span id="calibre_link-24559" class="verse-num">12</span>But the man said to Joab, "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king's son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake protect the young man Absalom.' <span id="calibre_link-24560" class="verse-num">13</span>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof." <span id="calibre_link-24561" class="verse-num">14</span>Joab said, "I will not waste time like this with you."

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24562"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them. <span id="calibre_link-24563" class="verse-num">17</span>And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home. <span id="calibre_link-24564" class="verse-num">18</span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance."

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, "Go up, raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite." <span id="calibre_link-24747" class="verse-num">19</span>So David went up at Gad's word, as the LORD commanded. <span id="calibre_link-24748" class="verse-num">20</span>And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground. <span id="calibre_link-24749" class="verse-num">21</span>And Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be averted from the people." <span id="calibre_link-24750" class="verse-num">22</span>Then Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. <span id="calibre_link-24751" class="verse-num">23</span>All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king." And Araunah said to the king, "May the LORD your God accept you." <span id="calibre_link-10840" class="verse-num">24</span>But the king said to Araunah, "No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. <span id="calibre_link-167" class="verse-num">25</span>And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</p>
