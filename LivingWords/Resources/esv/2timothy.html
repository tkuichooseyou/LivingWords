Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <span id="calibre_link-38743" class="verse-num">18</span>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. <span id="calibre_link-9102" class="verse-num">19</span>But God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-716"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. <span id="calibre_link-1802" class="verse-num">21</span>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-2413" id="calibre_link-12460">[4]</a></span> he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.</p>

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, <span id="calibre_link-7597" class="verse-num">26</span>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2008">2 TIMOTHY</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. <span id="calibre_link-729" class="verse-num">2</span>For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <span id="calibre_link-15832" class="verse-num">3</span>heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, <span id="calibre_link-4129" class="verse-num">4</span>treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <span id="calibre_link-434" class="verse-num">5</span>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. <span id="calibre_link-10214" class="verse-num">6</span>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, <span id="calibre_link-3821" class="verse-num">7</span>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. <span id="calibre_link-745" class="verse-num">8</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. <span id="calibre_link-12318" class="verse-num">9</span>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Do your best to come to me soon. <span id="calibre_link-10880" class="verse-num">10</span>For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
