<p id="calibre_link-8104" class="heading">Birth of John the Baptist Foretold</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-36637"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, <span id="calibre_link-4087" class="verse-num">9</span>according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <span id="calibre_link-36638" class="verse-num">10</span>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. <span id="calibre_link-10040" class="verse-num">11</span>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <span id="calibre_link-36639" class="verse-num">12</span>And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <span id="calibre_link-36640" class="verse-num">13</span>But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <span id="calibre_link-12934" class="verse-num">14</span>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, <span id="calibre_link-11708" class="verse-num">15</span>for he will be great before the Lord.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-36642"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this?

And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. <span id="calibre_link-36645" class="verse-num">23</span>And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-36646"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, <span id="calibre_link-36647" class="verse-num">25</span>"Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people."</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">50</span>Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea.

Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, <span id="calibre_link-3604" class="verse-num">7</span>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise." <span id="calibre_link-15463" class="verse-num">8</span>And they remembered his words, <span id="calibre_link-37189" class="verse-num">9</span>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <span id="calibre_link-37190" class="verse-num">10</span>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, <span id="calibre_link-37191" class="verse-num">11</span>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. <span id="calibre_link-3158" class="verse-num">12</span>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13314" class="heading">On the Road to Emmaus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <span id="calibre_link-37192" class="verse-num">14</span>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <span id="calibre_link-37193" class="verse-num">15</span>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <span id="calibre_link-37194" class="verse-num">16</span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <span id="calibre_link-6929" class="verse-num">17</span>And he said to them, <span>"What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?"</span> And they stood still, looking sad. <span id="calibre_link-37195" class="verse-num">18</span>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" <span id="calibre_link-4560" class="verse-num">19</span>And he said to them, <span>"What things?"</span> And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <span id="calibre_link-3323" class="verse-num">20</span>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span id="calibre_link-37196" class="verse-num">21</span>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <span id="calibre_link-4652" class="verse-num">22</span>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <span id="calibre_link-1841" class="verse-num">23</span>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <span id="calibre_link-37197" class="verse-num">24</span>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see." <span id="calibre_link-7583" class="verse-num">25</span>And he said to them, <span>"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span id="calibre_link-5054" class="verse-num">26</span><span>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"</span> <span id="calibre_link-7138" class="verse-num">27</span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37198"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <span id="calibre_link-37199" class="verse-num">29</span>but they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them. <span id="calibre_link-37200" class="verse-num">30</span>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <span id="calibre_link-1784" class="verse-num">31</span>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <span id="calibre_link-15559" class="verse-num">32</span>They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?" <span id="calibre_link-37201" class="verse-num">33</span>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <span id="calibre_link-15551" class="verse-num">34</span>saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!" <span id="calibre_link-13048" class="verse-num">35</span>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37202" class="heading">Jesus Appears to His Disciples</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span>"Peace to you!"</span> <span id="calibre_link-37203" class="verse-num">37</span>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. <span id="calibre_link-840" class="verse-num">38</span>And he said to them, <span>"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</span> <span id="calibre_link-10921" class="verse-num">39</span><span>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.

<p id="calibre_link-37206" class="heading">The Ascension</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">50</span>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. <span id="calibre_link-2873" class="verse-num">51</span>While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. <span id="calibre_link-37207" class="verse-num">52</span>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <span id="calibre_link-3409" class="verse-num">53</span>and were continually in the temple blessing God.</p>
