<p id="calibre_link-9111" class="heading">The Continuing Conquest of Canaan</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1969">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the LORD, "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?" <span id="calibre_link-22847" class="verse-num">2</span>The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand." <span id="calibre_link-22848" class="verse-num">3</span>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him. <span id="calibre_link-22849" class="verse-num">4</span>Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. <span id="calibre_link-22850" class="verse-num">5</span>They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. <span id="calibre_link-22851" class="verse-num">6</span>Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. <span id="calibre_link-22852" class="verse-num">7</span>And Adoni-bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22853"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. <span id="calibre_link-22854" class="verse-num">9</span>And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. <span id="calibre_link-22855" class="verse-num">10</span>And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22856"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. <span id="calibre_link-22857" class="verse-num">12</span>And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife." <span id="calibre_link-22858" class="verse-num">13</span>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife. <span id="calibre_link-22859" class="verse-num">14</span>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, "What do you want?" <span id="calibre_link-22860" class="verse-num">15</span>She said to him, "Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22861"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people. <span id="calibre_link-22862" class="verse-num">17</span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah. <span id="calibre_link-22863" class="verse-num">18</span>Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. <span id="calibre_link-22864" class="verse-num">19</span>And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron. <span id="calibre_link-22865" class="verse-num">20</span>And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. <span id="calibre_link-1212" class="verse-num">21</span>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22866"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. <span id="calibre_link-22867" class="verse-num">23</span>And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.) <span id="calibre_link-22868" class="verse-num">24</span>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you." <span id="calibre_link-22869" class="verse-num">25</span>And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. <span id="calibre_link-22870" class="verse-num">26</span>And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22871" class="heading">Failure to Complete the Conquest</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. <span id="calibre_link-22872" class="verse-num">28</span>When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22873"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22874"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22875"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob, <span id="calibre_link-22876" class="verse-num">32</span>so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22877"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22878"> <span class="verse-num">34</span>The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain. <span id="calibre_link-22879" class="verse-num">35</span>The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. <span id="calibre_link-22880" class="verse-num">36</span>And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13573" class="heading">Israel's Disobedience</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1969">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, <span id="calibre_link-22881" class="verse-num">2</span>and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done? <span id="calibre_link-22882" class="verse-num">3</span>So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you." <span id="calibre_link-22883" class="verse-num">4</span>As soon as the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. <span id="calibre_link-22884" class="verse-num">5</span>And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they sacrificed there to the LORD.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22885" class="heading">The Death of Joshua</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. <span id="calibre_link-22886" class="verse-num">7</span>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel. <span id="calibre_link-22887" class="verse-num">8</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110 years. <span id="calibre_link-22888" class="verse-num">9</span>And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. <span id="calibre_link-22889" class="verse-num">10</span>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22890" class="heading">Israel's Unfaithfulness</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. <span id="calibre_link-22891" class="verse-num">12</span>And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the LORD to anger. <span id="calibre_link-22892" class="verse-num">13</span>They abandoned the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. <span id="calibre_link-22893" class="verse-num">14</span>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. <span id="calibre_link-22894" class="verse-num">15</span>Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for harm, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1441" class="heading">The L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span> Raises Up Judges</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. <span id="calibre_link-22895" class="verse-num">17</span>Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so. <span id="calibre_link-22896" class="verse-num">18</span>Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them. <span id="calibre_link-22897" class="verse-num">19</span>But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. <span id="calibre_link-22898" class="verse-num">20</span>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, "Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice, <span id="calibre_link-22899" class="verse-num">21</span>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, <span id="calibre_link-22900" class="verse-num">22</span>in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not." <span id="calibre_link-22901" class="verse-num">23</span>So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13574"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1969">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Now these are the nations that the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. <span id="calibre_link-22902" class="verse-num">2</span>It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before. <span id="calibre_link-22903" class="verse-num">3</span>These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. <span id="calibre_link-22904" class="verse-num">4</span>They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. <span id="calibre_link-2834" class="verse-num">5</span>So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <span id="calibre_link-22905" class="verse-num">6</span>And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22906" class="heading">Othniel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD. They forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. <span id="calibre_link-22907" class="verse-num">8</span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. <span id="calibre_link-390" class="verse-num">9</span>But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. <span id="calibre_link-22908" class="verse-num">10</span>The Spirit of the LORD was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. <span id="calibre_link-22909" class="verse-num">11</span>So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22910" class="heading">Ehud</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. <span id="calibre_link-9888" class="verse-num">13</span>He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. <span id="calibre_link-22911" class="verse-num">14</span>And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22912"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, and the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. <span id="calibre_link-22913" class="verse-num">16</span>And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. <span id="calibre_link-22914" class="verse-num">17</span>And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. <span id="calibre_link-22915" class="verse-num">18</span>And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. <span id="calibre_link-22916" class="verse-num">19</span>But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence. <span id="calibre_link-22917" class="verse-num">20</span>And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat. <span id="calibre_link-22918" class="verse-num">21</span>And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. <span id="calibre_link-22919" class="verse-num">22</span>And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. <span id="calibre_link-22920" class="verse-num">23</span>Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22921"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber." <span id="calibre_link-22922" class="verse-num">25</span>And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22923"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. <span id="calibre_link-22924" class="verse-num">27</span>When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. <span id="calibre_link-22925" class="verse-num">28</span>And he said to them, "Follow after me, for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. <span id="calibre_link-22926" class="verse-num">29</span>And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. <span id="calibre_link-22927" class="verse-num">30</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-22928" class="heading">Shamgar</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13575" class="heading">Deborah and Barak</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1969">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died. <span id="calibre_link-22929" class="verse-num">2</span>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. <span id="calibre_link-22930" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-274"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. <span id="calibre_link-22931" class="verse-num">5</span>She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. <span id="calibre_link-12747" class="verse-num">6</span>She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, "Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, 'Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun. <span id="calibre_link-22932" class="verse-num">7</span>And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand'?" <span id="calibre_link-22933" class="verse-num">8</span>Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go." <span id="calibre_link-22934" class="verse-num">9</span>And she said, "I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. <span id="calibre_link-22935" class="verse-num">10</span>And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22936"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22937"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, <span id="calibre_link-22938" class="verse-num">13</span>Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. <span id="calibre_link-22939" class="verse-num">14</span>And Deborah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. <span id="calibre_link-22940" class="verse-num">15</span>And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. <span id="calibre_link-22941" class="verse-num">16</span>And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22942"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <span id="calibre_link-22943" class="verse-num">18</span>And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <span id="calibre_link-22944" class="verse-num">19</span>And he said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. <span id="calibre_link-22945" class="verse-num">20</span>And he said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'" <span id="calibre_link-22946" class="verse-num">21</span>But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. <span id="calibre_link-22947" class="verse-num">22</span>And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22948"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-22949" class="verse-num">24</span>And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. <span id="calibre_link-22990" class="verse-num">12</span>And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor." <span id="calibre_link-22991" class="verse-num">13</span>And Gideon said to him, "Please, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us?

But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian." <span id="calibre_link-22992" class="verse-num">14</span>And the LORD turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?" <span id="calibre_link-22993" class="verse-num">15</span>And he said to him, "Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house." <span id="calibre_link-22994" class="verse-num">16</span>And the LORD said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man." <span id="calibre_link-22995" class="verse-num">17</span>And he said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. <span id="calibre_link-22996" class="verse-num">18</span>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you."

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-22997"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour.

And he did so. <span id="calibre_link-22999" class="verse-num">21</span>Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. <span id="calibre_link-23000" class="verse-num">22</span>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23003"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>That night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it <span id="calibre_link-23004" class="verse-num">26</span>and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23011"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. <span id="calibre_link-23012" class="verse-num">34</span>But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. <span id="calibre_link-23013" class="verse-num">35</span>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him.

<p id="calibre_link-23014" class="heading">The Sign of the Fleece</p>

When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. <span id="calibre_link-12290" class="verse-num">39</span>Then Gideon said to God, "Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23019"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23022"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. <span id="calibre_link-23023" class="verse-num">10</span>But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant. <span id="calibre_link-23024" class="verse-num">11</span>And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp."

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23256"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Then Delilah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound."

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23358"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Then the people of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. <span id="calibre_link-23359" class="verse-num">20</span>And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin, and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. <span id="calibre_link-23360" class="verse-num">21</span>The people of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and destroyed on that day 22,000 men of the Israelites. <span id="calibre_link-23361" class="verse-num">22</span>But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day. <span id="calibre_link-23362" class="verse-num">23</span>And the people of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until the evening. And they inquired of the LORD, "Shall we again draw near to fight against our brothers, the people of Benjamin?" And the LORD said, "Go up against them."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23363"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>So the people of Israel came near against the people of Benjamin the second day. <span id="calibre_link-23364" class="verse-num">25</span>And Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed 18,000 men of the people of Israel. All these were men who drew the sword. <span id="calibre_link-23365" class="verse-num">26</span>Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. <span id="calibre_link-23366" class="verse-num">27</span>And the people of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, <span id="calibre_link-23367" class="verse-num">28</span>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, "Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the LORD said, "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23368"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. <span id="calibre_link-23369" class="verse-num">30</span>And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. <span id="calibre_link-23370" class="verse-num">31</span>And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-23371" class="verse-num">32</span>And the people of Benjamin said, "They are routed before us, as at the first." But the people of Israel said, "Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways." <span id="calibre_link-23372" class="verse-num">33</span>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba. <span id="calibre_link-23373" class="verse-num">34</span>And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them. <span id="calibre_link-23374" class="verse-num">35</span>And the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day. All these were men who drew the sword. <span id="calibre_link-23375" class="verse-num">36</span>So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated.</p>
<p class="crossway">The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. <span id="calibre_link-23376" class="verse-num">37</span>Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. <span id="calibre_link-23377" class="verse-num">38</span>Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city <span id="calibre_link-23378" class="verse-num">39</span>the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, "Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle." <span id="calibre_link-23379" class="verse-num">40</span>But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. <span id="calibre_link-23380" class="verse-num">41</span>Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them. <span id="calibre_link-23381" class="verse-num">42</span>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst. <span id="calibre_link-23382" class="verse-num">43</span>Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah as far as opposite Gibeah on the east. <span id="calibre_link-23383" class="verse-num">44</span>Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor. <span id="calibre_link-23384" class="verse-num">45</span>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down. <span id="calibre_link-23385" class="verse-num">46</span>So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor. <span id="calibre_link-23386" class="verse-num">47</span>But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. <span id="calibre_link-23387" class="verse-num">48</span>And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1969">JUDGES</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 21 </span>Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, "No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin." <span id="calibre_link-23388" class="verse-num">2</span>And the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. <span id="calibre_link-23389" class="verse-num">3</span>And they said, "O LORD, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?" <span id="calibre_link-23390" class="verse-num">4</span>And the next day the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. <span id="calibre_link-23391" class="verse-num">5</span>And the people of Israel said, "Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?" For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah, saying, "He shall surely be put to death." <span id="calibre_link-23392" class="verse-num">6</span>And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, "One tribe is cut off from Israel this day. <span id="calibre_link-23393" class="verse-num">7</span>What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives?"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23394"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And they said, "What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the LORD to Mizpah?"

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23399"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and proclaimed peace to them. <span id="calibre_link-23400" class="verse-num">14</span>And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them. <span id="calibre_link-23401" class="verse-num">15</span>And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23402"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Then the elders of the congregation said, "What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?" <span id="calibre_link-23403" class="verse-num">17</span>And they said, "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. <span id="calibre_link-23404" class="verse-num">18</span>Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters." For the people of Israel had sworn, "Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin." <span id="calibre_link-23405" class="verse-num">19</span>So they said, "Behold, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." <span id="calibre_link-23406" class="verse-num">20</span>And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, "Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards <span id="calibre_link-23407" class="verse-num">21</span>and watch.
