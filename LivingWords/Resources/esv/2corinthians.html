<p id="calibre_link-10014" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,</p>
<p class="crossway">To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38470"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3218" class="heading">God of All Comfort</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, <span id="calibre_link-3219" class="verse-num">4</span>who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. <span id="calibre_link-3053" class="verse-num">5</span>For as we share abundantly in Christ&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. <span id="calibre_link-7914" class="verse-num">6</span>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. <span id="calibre_link-38471" class="verse-num">7</span>Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10177"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. <span id="calibre_link-15453" class="verse-num">9</span>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. <span id="calibre_link-232" class="verse-num">10</span>He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. <span id="calibre_link-8509" class="verse-num">11</span>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3366" class="heading">Paul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Change of Plans</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. <span id="calibre_link-38472" class="verse-num">13</span>For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-38473" class="verse-num">14</span>just as you did partially understand us&mdash;that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38474"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. <span id="calibre_link-38475" class="verse-num">16</span>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. <span id="calibre_link-38476" class="verse-num">17</span>Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say &acirc;&#128;&#156;Yes, yes&acirc;&#128;&#157; and &acirc;&#128;&#156;No, no&acirc;&#128;&#157; at the same time? <span id="calibre_link-38477" class="verse-num">18</span>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. <span id="calibre_link-38478" class="verse-num">19</span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. <span id="calibre_link-1117" class="verse-num">20</span>For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. <span id="calibre_link-9966" class="verse-num">21</span>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, <span id="calibre_link-7153" class="verse-num">22</span>and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38479"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>But I call God to witness against me&mdash;it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. <span id="calibre_link-12270" class="verse-num">24</span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15060"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. <span id="calibre_link-38480" class="verse-num">2</span>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? <span id="calibre_link-38481" class="verse-num">3</span>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. <span id="calibre_link-9663" class="verse-num">4</span>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38482" class="heading">Forgive the Sinner</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure&mdash;not to put it too severely&mdash;to all of you. <span id="calibre_link-8702" class="verse-num">6</span>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, <span id="calibre_link-38483" class="verse-num">7</span>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. <span id="calibre_link-12826" class="verse-num">8</span>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. <span id="calibre_link-8770" class="verse-num">9</span>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. <span id="calibre_link-38484" class="verse-num">10</span>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, <span id="calibre_link-9029" class="verse-num">11</span>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10991" class="heading">Triumph in Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, <span id="calibre_link-38485" class="verse-num">13</span>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9867"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. <span id="calibre_link-3046" class="verse-num">15</span>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, <span id="calibre_link-38486" class="verse-num">16</span>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? <span id="calibre_link-38487" class="verse-num">17</span>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-15061" class="heading">Ministers of the New Covenant</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? <span id="calibre_link-38488" class="verse-num">2</span>You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. <span id="calibre_link-9105" class="verse-num">3</span>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38489"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. <span id="calibre_link-7930" class="verse-num">5</span>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, <span id="calibre_link-3864" class="verse-num">6</span>who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-2879"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses&acirc;&#128;&#153; face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, <span id="calibre_link-38490" class="verse-num">8</span>will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? <span id="calibre_link-38491" class="verse-num">9</span>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. <span id="calibre_link-7954" class="verse-num">10</span>Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. <span id="calibre_link-38492" class="verse-num">11</span>For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13015"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, <span id="calibre_link-38493" class="verse-num">13</span>not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. <span id="calibre_link-3506" class="verse-num">14</span>But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. <span id="calibre_link-38494" class="verse-num">15</span>Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. <span id="calibre_link-1793" class="verse-num">16</span>But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. <span id="calibre_link-7732" class="verse-num">17</span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <span id="calibre_link-10937" class="verse-num">18</span>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-15062" class="heading">The Light of the Gospel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. <span id="calibre_link-38495" class="verse-num">2</span>But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone&acirc;&#128;&#153;s conscience in the sight of God. <span id="calibre_link-8257" class="verse-num">3</span>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. <span id="calibre_link-4576" class="verse-num">4</span>In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. <span id="calibre_link-1294" class="verse-num">5</span>For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus&acirc;&#128;&#153; sake. <span id="calibre_link-7400" class="verse-num">6</span>For God, who said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let light shine out of darkness,&acirc;&#128;&#157; has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1194" class="heading">Treasure in Jars of Clay</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. <span id="calibre_link-506" class="verse-num">8</span>We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; <span id="calibre_link-8262" class="verse-num">9</span>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; <span id="calibre_link-4397" class="verse-num">10</span>always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. <span id="calibre_link-38496" class="verse-num">11</span>For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus&acirc;&#128;&#153; sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. <span id="calibre_link-38497" class="verse-num">12</span>So death is at work in us, but life in you.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38498"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I believed, and so I spoke,&acirc;&#128;&#157; we also believe, and so we also speak, <span id="calibre_link-8551" class="verse-num">14</span>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. <span id="calibre_link-38499" class="verse-num">15</span>For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4071"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. <span id="calibre_link-9775" class="verse-num">17</span>For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, <span id="calibre_link-4027" class="verse-num">18</span>as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-530" class="heading">Our Heavenly Dwelling</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 5 </span>For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. <span id="calibre_link-938" class="verse-num">2</span>For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, <span id="calibre_link-4963" class="verse-num">3</span>if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. <span id="calibre_link-4655" class="verse-num">4</span>For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened&mdash;not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. <span id="calibre_link-8547" class="verse-num">5</span>He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9868"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, <span id="calibre_link-11498" class="verse-num">7</span>for we walk by faith, not by sight. <span id="calibre_link-38500" class="verse-num">8</span>Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-8395" class="verse-num">9</span>So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. <span id="calibre_link-914" class="verse-num">10</span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8275" class="heading">The Ministry of Reconciliation</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. <span id="calibre_link-9986" class="verse-num">12</span>We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. <span id="calibre_link-38501" class="verse-num">13</span>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. <span id="calibre_link-3424" class="verse-num">14</span>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; <span id="calibre_link-3981" class="verse-num">15</span>and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12297"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. <span id="calibre_link-3047" class="verse-num">17</span>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. <span id="calibre_link-4592" class="verse-num">18</span>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; <span id="calibre_link-4532" class="verse-num">19</span>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. <span id="calibre_link-9880" class="verse-num">20</span>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. <span id="calibre_link-6953" class="verse-num">21</span>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1773"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 6 </span>Working together with him, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain. <span id="calibre_link-6969" class="verse-num">2</span>For he says,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;In a favorable time I listened to you,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and in a day of salvation I have helped you.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. <span id="calibre_link-8784" class="verse-num">3</span>We put no obstacle in anyone&acirc;&#128;&#153;s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, <span id="calibre_link-2773" class="verse-num">4</span>but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, <span id="calibre_link-7577" class="verse-num">5</span>beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; <span id="calibre_link-8713" class="verse-num">6</span>by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love; <span id="calibre_link-11572" class="verse-num">7</span>by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; <span id="calibre_link-9054" class="verse-num">8</span>through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; <span id="calibre_link-38502" class="verse-num">9</span>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed; <span id="calibre_link-13413" class="verse-num">10</span>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8836"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open. <span id="calibre_link-38503" class="verse-num">12</span>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. <span id="calibre_link-38504" class="verse-num">13</span>In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-147" class="heading">The Temple of the Living God</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? <span id="calibre_link-8446" class="verse-num">15</span>What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever? <span id="calibre_link-939" class="verse-num">16</span>What agreement has the temple of God with idols?

<p id="calibre_link-15587" class="heading">Paul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Joy</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. <span id="calibre_link-38505" class="verse-num">3</span>I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. <span id="calibre_link-8872" class="verse-num">4</span>I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38506"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn&mdash;fighting without and fear within. <span id="calibre_link-845" class="verse-num">6</span>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus, <span id="calibre_link-38507" class="verse-num">7</span>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more. <span id="calibre_link-13991" class="verse-num">8</span>For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it&mdash;though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while. <span id="calibre_link-13989" class="verse-num">9</span>As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8608"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. <span id="calibre_link-3133" class="verse-num">11</span>For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter. <span id="calibre_link-38508" class="verse-num">12</span>So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God. <span id="calibre_link-38509" class="verse-num">13</span>Therefore we are comforted.</p>
<p class="crossway">And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. <span id="calibre_link-38510" class="verse-num">14</span>For whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2001">2 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 8 </span>We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, <span id="calibre_link-38512" class="verse-num">2</span>for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part. <span id="calibre_link-12926" class="verse-num">3</span>For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord, <span id="calibre_link-15451" class="verse-num">4</span>begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-38513" class="verse-num">5</span>and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. <span id="calibre_link-9717" class="verse-num">6</span>Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace. <span id="calibre_link-7708" class="verse-num">7</span>But as you excel in everything&mdash;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you&mdash;see that you excel in this act of grace also.</p>
