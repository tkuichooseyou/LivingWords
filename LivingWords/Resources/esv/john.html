<p id="calibre_link-11159" class="heading">The Word Became Flesh</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <span id="calibre_link-12828" class="verse-num">2</span>He was in the beginning with God. <span id="calibre_link-4334" class="verse-num">3</span>All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. <span id="calibre_link-3901" class="verse-num">4</span>In him was life, and the life was the light of men. <span id="calibre_link-3923" class="verse-num">5</span>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37209"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <span id="calibre_link-12793" class="verse-num">7</span>He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. <span id="calibre_link-11688" class="verse-num">8</span>He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-11004"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. <span id="calibre_link-12588" class="verse-num">10</span>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. <span id="calibre_link-8884" class="verse-num">11</span>He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <span id="calibre_link-3009" class="verse-num">12</span>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, <span id="calibre_link-11634" class="verse-num">13</span>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-951"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <span id="calibre_link-37210" class="verse-num">15</span>(John bore witness about him, and cried out, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.'") <span id="calibre_link-12408" class="verse-num">16</span>For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. <span id="calibre_link-3759" class="verse-num">17</span>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-7227" class="verse-num">18</span>No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37211" class="heading">The Testimony of John the Baptist</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" <span id="calibre_link-37212" class="verse-num">20</span>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." <span id="calibre_link-13308" class="verse-num">21</span>And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" And he answered, "No." <span id="calibre_link-37213" class="verse-num">22</span>So they said to him, "Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?" <span id="calibre_link-37214" class="verse-num">23</span>He said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37215"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>(Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) <span id="calibre_link-37216" class="verse-num">25</span>They asked him, "Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?" <span id="calibre_link-12736" class="verse-num">26</span>John answered them, "I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know, <span id="calibre_link-37217" class="verse-num">27</span>even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie." <span id="calibre_link-37218" class="verse-num">28</span>These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3697" class="heading">Behold, the Lamb of God</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">29</span>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <span id="calibre_link-37219" class="verse-num">30</span>This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.' <span id="calibre_link-12744" class="verse-num">31</span>I myself did not know him, but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel." <span id="calibre_link-459" class="verse-num">32</span>And John bore witness: "I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. <span id="calibre_link-12737" class="verse-num">33</span>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' <span id="calibre_link-13030" class="verse-num">34</span>And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37220" class="heading">Jesus Calls the First Disciples</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">35</span>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, <span id="calibre_link-37221" class="verse-num">36</span>and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!" <span id="calibre_link-37222" class="verse-num">37</span>The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-15363" class="verse-num">38</span>Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, <span>"What are you seeking?"</span> And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?" <span id="calibre_link-37223" class="verse-num">39</span>He said to them, <span>"Come and you will see."</span> So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. <span id="calibre_link-9906" class="verse-num">40</span>One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. <span id="calibre_link-4537" class="verse-num">41</span>He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ). <span id="calibre_link-2931" class="verse-num">42</span>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, <span>"You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas"</span> (which means Peter).</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8307" class="heading">Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">43</span>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, <span>"Follow me."</span> <span id="calibre_link-37224" class="verse-num">44</span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. <span id="calibre_link-37225" class="verse-num">45</span>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." <span id="calibre_link-5005" class="verse-num">46</span>Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see." <span id="calibre_link-9191" class="verse-num">47</span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, <span>"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"</span> <span id="calibre_link-37226" class="verse-num">48</span>Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, <span>"Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</span> <span id="calibre_link-12559" class="verse-num">49</span>Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" <span id="calibre_link-37227" class="verse-num">50</span>Jesus answered him, <span>"Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</span> <span id="calibre_link-4378" class="verse-num">51</span>And he said to him, <span>"Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2826" class="heading">The Wedding at Cana</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. <span id="calibre_link-37228" class="verse-num">2</span>Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. <span id="calibre_link-37229" class="verse-num">3</span>When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine." <span id="calibre_link-37230" class="verse-num">4</span>And Jesus said to her, <span>"Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come."</span> <span id="calibre_link-4683" class="verse-num">5</span>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1193"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. <span id="calibre_link-12250" class="verse-num">7</span>Jesus said to the servants, <span>"Fill the jars with water."</span> And they filled them up to the brim. <span id="calibre_link-37231" class="verse-num">8</span>And he said to them, <span>"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast."</span> So they took it. <span id="calibre_link-11549" class="verse-num">9</span>When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom <span id="calibre_link-37232" class="verse-num">10</span>and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now." <span id="calibre_link-12272" class="verse-num">11</span>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37233"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37234" class="heading">Jesus Cleanses the Temple</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-4636" class="verse-num">14</span>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. <span id="calibre_link-3179" class="verse-num">15</span>And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. <span id="calibre_link-15901" class="verse-num">16</span>And he told those who sold the pigeons, <span>"Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade."</span> <span id="calibre_link-3389" class="verse-num">17</span>His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume me."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37235"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>So the Jews said to him, "What sign do you show us for doing these things?" <span id="calibre_link-10732" class="verse-num">19</span>Jesus answered them, <span>"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</span> <span id="calibre_link-37236" class="verse-num">20</span>The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?" <span id="calibre_link-37237" class="verse-num">21</span>But he was speaking about the temple of his body. <span id="calibre_link-37238" class="verse-num">22</span>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12861" class="heading">Jesus Knows What Is in Man</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. <span id="calibre_link-13364" class="verse-num">24</span>But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people <span id="calibre_link-12583" class="verse-num">25</span>and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5104" class="heading">You Must Be Born Again</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-5111" class="verse-num">2</span>This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him." <span id="calibre_link-13028" class="verse-num">3</span>Jesus answered him, <span>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."</span> <span id="calibre_link-11711" class="verse-num">4</span>Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" <span id="calibre_link-7729" class="verse-num">5</span>Jesus answered, <span>"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span id="calibre_link-12295" class="verse-num">6</span><span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span id="calibre_link-37239" class="verse-num">7</span><span>Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'</span> <span id="calibre_link-11645" class="verse-num">8</span><span>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

<p id="calibre_link-37244" class="heading">John the Baptist Exalts Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. <span id="calibre_link-12740" class="verse-num">23</span>John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized <span id="calibre_link-37245" class="verse-num">24</span>(for John had not yet been put in prison).</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37246"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification. <span id="calibre_link-37247" class="verse-num">26</span>And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness-look, he is baptizing, and all are going to him." <span id="calibre_link-37248" class="verse-num">27</span>John answered, "A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. <span id="calibre_link-37249" class="verse-num">28</span>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.' <span id="calibre_link-13064" class="verse-num">29</span>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John <span id="calibre_link-12738" class="verse-num">2</span>(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), <span id="calibre_link-37254" class="verse-num">3</span>he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. <span id="calibre_link-6977" class="verse-num">4</span>And he had to pass through Samaria. <span id="calibre_link-37255" class="verse-num">5</span>So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <span id="calibre_link-1387" class="verse-num">6</span>Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well.

<p id="calibre_link-4718" class="heading">Jesus Raises Lazarus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">38</span>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.

<p id="calibre_link-37575" class="heading">The High Priest Questions Jesus</p>

<p id="calibre_link-37581" class="heading">Jesus Before Pilate</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover. <span id="calibre_link-9698" class="verse-num">29</span>So Pilate went outside to them and said, "What accusation do you bring against this man?" <span id="calibre_link-37582" class="verse-num">30</span>They answered him, "If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you." <span id="calibre_link-3773" class="verse-num">31</span>Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law."

<p id="calibre_link-37584" class="heading">My Kingdom Is Not of This World</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">33</span>So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" <span id="calibre_link-37585" class="verse-num">34</span>Jesus answered, <span>"Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?"</span> <span id="calibre_link-37586" class="verse-num">35</span>Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?" <span id="calibre_link-11768" class="verse-num">36</span>Jesus answered, <span>"My kingdom is not of this world.

But my kingdom is not from the world."</span> <span id="calibre_link-1858" class="verse-num">37</span>Then Pilate said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, <span>"You say that I am a king.

<p class="crossway">After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, "I find no guilt in him. <span id="calibre_link-37587" class="verse-num">39</span>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" <span id="calibre_link-37588" class="verse-num">40</span>They cried out again, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11169" class="heading">Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 19 </span>Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him. <span id="calibre_link-10117" class="verse-num">2</span>And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe. <span id="calibre_link-37589" class="verse-num">3</span>They came up to him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and struck him with their hands. <span id="calibre_link-37590" class="verse-num">4</span>Pilate went out again and said to them, "See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him." <span id="calibre_link-3592" class="verse-num">5</span>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!" <span id="calibre_link-37591" class="verse-num">6</span>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him." <span id="calibre_link-37592" class="verse-num">7</span>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God." <span id="calibre_link-37593" class="verse-num">8</span>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid. <span id="calibre_link-9984" class="verse-num">9</span>He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. <span id="calibre_link-37594" class="verse-num">10</span>So Pilate said to him, "You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?" <span id="calibre_link-9640" class="verse-num">11</span>Jesus answered him, <span>"You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin."</span></p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37595"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar." <span id="calibre_link-7169" class="verse-num">13</span>So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha. <span id="calibre_link-37596" class="verse-num">14</span>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold your King!" <span id="calibre_link-3613" class="verse-num">15</span>They cried out, "Away with him, away with him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar." <span id="calibre_link-37597" class="verse-num">16</span>So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</p>
<p class="heading">The Crucifixion</p>
<p class="calibre9"> So they took Jesus, <span id="calibre_link-7542" class="verse-num">17</span>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha. <span id="calibre_link-3605" class="verse-num">18</span>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them. <span id="calibre_link-5033" class="verse-num">19</span>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." <span id="calibre_link-10076" class="verse-num">20</span>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek. <span id="calibre_link-37598" class="verse-num">21</span>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'" <span id="calibre_link-8329" class="verse-num">22</span>Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7618"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, <span id="calibre_link-773" class="verse-num">24</span>so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</p>
<p class="line-group"> "They divided my garments among them,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and for my clothing they cast lots."</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">So the soldiers did these things, <span id="calibre_link-3579" class="verse-num">25</span>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <span id="calibre_link-670" class="verse-num">26</span>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span>"Woman, behold, your son!"</span> <span id="calibre_link-4684" class="verse-num">27</span>Then he said to the disciple, <span>"Behold, your mother!"</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span>"I thirst."</span> <span id="calibre_link-15917" class="verse-num">29</span>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. <span id="calibre_link-12262" class="verse-num">30</span>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span>"It is finished,"</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37599" class="heading">Jesus' Side Is Pierced</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. <span id="calibre_link-37600" class="verse-num">32</span>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. <span id="calibre_link-3844" class="verse-num">33</span>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <span id="calibre_link-7429" class="verse-num">34</span>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. <span id="calibre_link-37601" class="verse-num">35</span>He who saw it has borne witness-his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth-that you also may believe. <span id="calibre_link-13020" class="verse-num">36</span>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken." <span id="calibre_link-7135" class="verse-num">37</span>And again another Scripture says, "They will look on him whom they have pierced."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1287" class="heading">Jesus Is Buried</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">38</span>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. <span id="calibre_link-4750" class="verse-num">39</span>Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds in weight. <span id="calibre_link-3159" class="verse-num">40</span>So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-13829" class="verse-num">41</span>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. <span id="calibre_link-37602" class="verse-num">42</span>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p>

He saw the linen cloths lying there, <span id="calibre_link-3143" class="verse-num">7</span>and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. <span id="calibre_link-37607" class="verse-num">8</span>Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; <span id="calibre_link-15548" class="verse-num">9</span>for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <span id="calibre_link-12704" class="verse-num">10</span>Then the disciples went back to their homes.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4443" class="heading">Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. <span id="calibre_link-9923" class="verse-num">12</span>And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. <span id="calibre_link-11705" class="verse-num">13</span>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him." <span id="calibre_link-37608" class="verse-num">14</span>Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-37609" class="verse-num">15</span>Jesus said to her, <span>"Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?"</span> Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away." <span id="calibre_link-37610" class="verse-num">16</span>Jesus said to her, <span>"Mary."</span> She turned and said to him in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher). <span id="calibre_link-10153" class="verse-num">17</span>Jesus said to her, <span>"Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</span> <span id="calibre_link-4336" class="verse-num">18</span>Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord"-and that he had said these things to her.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-37611" class="heading">Jesus Appears to the Disciples</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, <span>"Peace be with you."</span> <span id="calibre_link-7430" class="verse-num">20</span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-7247" class="verse-num">21</span>Jesus said to them again, <span>"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you."</span> <span id="calibre_link-13056" class="verse-num">22</span>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, <span>"Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span id="calibre_link-7525" class="verse-num">23</span><span>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any, it is withheld."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-37612" class="heading">Jesus and Thomas</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. <span id="calibre_link-4060" class="verse-num">25</span>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4004"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <span>"Peace be with you."</span> <span id="calibre_link-10825" class="verse-num">27</span>Then he said to Thomas, <span>"Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe."</span> <span id="calibre_link-13927" class="verse-num">28</span>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!" <span id="calibre_link-12863" class="verse-num">29</span>Jesus said to him, <span>"Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-7445" class="heading">The Purpose of This Book</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; <span id="calibre_link-4978" class="verse-num">31</span>but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11170" class="heading">Jesus Appears to Seven Disciples</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1999">JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 21 </span>After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. <span id="calibre_link-5006" class="verse-num">2</span>Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. <span id="calibre_link-37613" class="verse-num">3</span>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37614"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-37615" class="verse-num">5</span>Jesus said to them, <span>"Children, do you have any fish?"</span> They answered him, "No." <span id="calibre_link-5087" class="verse-num">6</span>He said to them, <span>"Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some."</span> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. <span id="calibre_link-37616" class="verse-num">7</span>That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. <span id="calibre_link-37617" class="verse-num">8</span>The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-37618"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. <span id="calibre_link-37619" class="verse-num">10</span>Jesus said to them, <span>"Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."</span> <span id="calibre_link-7469" class="verse-num">11</span>So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn. <span id="calibre_link-37620" class="verse-num">12</span>Jesus said to them, <span>"Come and have breakfast."</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-37621" class="verse-num">13</span>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. <span id="calibre_link-37622" class="verse-num">14</span>This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3706" class="heading">Jesus and Peter</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span>"Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"</span> He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, <span>"Feed my lambs."</span> <span id="calibre_link-4100" class="verse-num">16</span>He said to him a second time, <span>"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"</span> He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, <span>"Tend my sheep."</span> <span id="calibre_link-12228" class="verse-num">17</span>He said to him the third time, <span>"Simon, son of John, do you love me?"</span> Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, <span>"Do you love me?"</span> and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, <span>"Feed my sheep.</span> <span id="calibre_link-7845" class="verse-num">18</span><span>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go."</span> <span id="calibre_link-37623" class="verse-num">19</span>(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <span>"Follow me."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-12907" class="heading">Jesus and the Beloved Apostle</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, "Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?" <span id="calibre_link-37624" class="verse-num">21</span>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?" <span id="calibre_link-37625" class="verse-num">22</span>Jesus said to him, <span>"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!"</span> <span id="calibre_link-37626" class="verse-num">23</span>So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <span>"If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"</span></p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10787"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3393"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</p>
