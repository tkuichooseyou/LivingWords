<p id="calibre_link-1223" class="heading">Daniel Taken to Babylon</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1985">DANIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. <span id="calibre_link-34830" class="verse-num">2</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the vessels in the treasury of his god. <span id="calibre_link-34831" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility, <span id="calibre_link-2948" class="verse-num">4</span>youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace, and to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. <span id="calibre_link-34832" class="verse-num">5</span>The king assigned them a daily portion of the food that the king ate, and of the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years, and at the end of that time they were to stand before the king. <span id="calibre_link-34833" class="verse-num">6</span>Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. <span id="calibre_link-122" class="verse-num">7</span>And the chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar, Hananiah he called Shadrach, Mishael he called Meshach, and Azariah he called Abednego.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-353" class="heading">Daniel's Faithfulness</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king's food, or with the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself. <span id="calibre_link-123" class="verse-num">9</span>And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs, <span id="calibre_link-34834" class="verse-num">10</span>and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age? So you would endanger my head with the king." <span id="calibre_link-34835" class="verse-num">11</span>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <span id="calibre_link-1789" class="verse-num">12</span>"Test your servants for ten days; let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. <span id="calibre_link-34836" class="verse-num">13</span>Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see." <span id="calibre_link-34837" class="verse-num">14</span>So he listened to them in this matter, and tested them for ten days. <span id="calibre_link-34838" class="verse-num">15</span>At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king's food. <span id="calibre_link-34839" class="verse-num">16</span>So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1846"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>As for these four youths, God gave them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <span id="calibre_link-5052" class="verse-num">18</span>At the end of the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <span id="calibre_link-34840" class="verse-num">19</span>And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they stood before the king. <span id="calibre_link-34841" class="verse-num">20</span>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his kingdom. <span id="calibre_link-3663" class="verse-num">21</span>And Daniel was there until the first year of King Cyrus.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9553" class="heading">Nebuchadnezzar's Dream</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1985">DANIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him. <span id="calibre_link-34842" class="verse-num">2</span>Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned to tell the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king. <span id="calibre_link-34843" class="verse-num">3</span>And the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream." <span id="calibre_link-10075" class="verse-num">4</span>Then the Chaldeans said to the king in Aramaic, "O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation." <span id="calibre_link-34844" class="verse-num">5</span>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, "The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins. <span id="calibre_link-868" class="verse-num">6</span>But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation." <span id="calibre_link-34845" class="verse-num">7</span>They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation." <span id="calibre_link-34846" class="verse-num">8</span>The king answered and said, "I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see that the word from me is firm&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-34847" class="verse-num">9</span>if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation." <span id="calibre_link-34848" class="verse-num">10</span>The Chaldeans answered the king and said, "There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand, for no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean. <span id="calibre_link-34849" class="verse-num">11</span>The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34850"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed. <span id="calibre_link-34851" class="verse-num">13</span>So the decree went out, and the wise men were about to be killed; and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them. <span id="calibre_link-699" class="verse-num">14</span>Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon. <span id="calibre_link-34852" class="verse-num">15</span>He declared to Arioch, the king's captain, "Why is the decree of the king so urgent?" Then Arioch made the matter known to Daniel. <span id="calibre_link-34853" class="verse-num">16</span>And Daniel went in and requested the king to appoint him a time, that he might show the interpretation to the king.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-34854" class="heading">God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar's Dream</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, <span id="calibre_link-34855" class="verse-num">18</span>and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <span id="calibre_link-34856" class="verse-num">19</span>Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <span id="calibre_link-34857" class="verse-num">20</span>Daniel answered and said:</p>
<p class="line-group"> "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,</p>
<p class="line-indent">to whom belong wisdom and might.</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-7166" class="verse-num">21</span> He changes times and seasons;</p>
<p class="line-indent">he removes kings and sets up kings;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">he gives wisdom to the wise</p>
<p class="line-indent">and knowledge to those who have understanding;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-944" class="verse-num">22</span> he reveals deep and hidden things;</p>
<p class="line-indent">he knows what is in the darkness,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and the light dwells with him.</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-34858" class="verse-num">23</span> To you, O God of my fathers,</p>
<p class="line-indent">I give thanks and praise,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">for you have given me wisdom and might,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and have now made known to me what we asked of you,</p>
<p class="line-indent">for you have made known to us the king's matter."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-34859" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-34860" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus to him: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation." <span id="calibre_link-34861" class="verse-num">26</span>The king declared to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?" <span id="calibre_link-34862" class="verse-num">27</span>Daniel answered the king and said, "No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked, <span id="calibre_link-4751" class="verse-num">28</span>but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these: <span id="calibre_link-34863" class="verse-num">29</span>To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be. <span id="calibre_link-34864" class="verse-num">30</span>But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your mind.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-34865" class="heading">Daniel Interprets the Dream</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>"You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was frightening. <span id="calibre_link-10106" class="verse-num">32</span>The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its middle and thighs of bronze, <span id="calibre_link-3117" class="verse-num">33</span>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. <span id="calibre_link-7799" class="verse-num">34</span>As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. <span id="calibre_link-4688" class="verse-num">35</span>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34866"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>"This was the dream. Now we will tell the king its interpretation. <span id="calibre_link-34867" class="verse-num">37</span>You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory, <span id="calibre_link-34868" class="verse-num">38</span>and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens, making you rule over them all&mdash;you are the head of gold. <span id="calibre_link-34869" class="verse-num">39</span>Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you, and yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. <span id="calibre_link-34870" class="verse-num">40</span>And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things. And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these. <span id="calibre_link-34871" class="verse-num">41</span>And as you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom, but some of the firmness of iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay. <span id="calibre_link-34872" class="verse-num">42</span>And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle. <span id="calibre_link-34873" class="verse-num">43</span>As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so they will mix with one another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay. <span id="calibre_link-528" class="verse-num">44</span>And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, nor shall the kingdom be left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and bring them to an end, and it shall stand forever, <span id="calibre_link-34874" class="verse-num">45</span>just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall be after this. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5053" class="heading">Daniel Is Promoted</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">46</span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and paid homage to Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to him. <span id="calibre_link-12564" class="verse-num">47</span>The king answered and said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this mystery." <span id="calibre_link-34875" class="verse-num">48</span>Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. <span id="calibre_link-34876" class="verse-num">49</span>Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king's court.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9036" class="heading">Nebuchadnezzar's Golden Image</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1985">DANIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits. He set it up on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <span id="calibre_link-34877" class="verse-num">2</span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <span id="calibre_link-34878" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the justices, the magistrates, and all the officials of the provinces gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <span id="calibre_link-34879" class="verse-num">4</span>And the herald proclaimed aloud, "You are commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, <span id="calibre_link-34880" class="verse-num">5</span>that when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <span id="calibre_link-12409" class="verse-num">6</span>And whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace." <span id="calibre_link-34881" class="verse-num">7</span>Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9702" class="heading">The Fiery Furnace</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-34882" class="verse-num">9</span>They declared to King Nebuchadnezzar, "O king, live forever! <span id="calibre_link-34883" class="verse-num">10</span>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image. <span id="calibre_link-34884" class="verse-num">11</span>And whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace. <span id="calibre_link-34885" class="verse-num">12</span>There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, pay no attention to you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34886"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king. <span id="calibre_link-34887" class="verse-num">14</span>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, "Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up? <span id="calibre_link-34888" class="verse-num">15</span>Now if you are ready when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands?"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34889"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. <span id="calibre_link-9615" class="verse-num">17</span>If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. <span id="calibre_link-34890" class="verse-num">18</span>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34891"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than it was usually heated. <span id="calibre_link-34892" class="verse-num">20</span>And he ordered some of the mighty men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <span id="calibre_link-34893" class="verse-num">21</span>Then these men were bound in their cloaks, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the burning fiery furnace. <span id="calibre_link-34894" class="verse-num">22</span>Because the king's order was urgent and the furnace overheated, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. <span id="calibre_link-34895" class="verse-num">23</span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34896"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He declared to his counselors, "Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?"

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34897"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace; he declared, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out, and come here!" Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire. <span id="calibre_link-34898" class="verse-num">27</span>And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king's counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men. The hair of their heads was not singed, their cloaks were not harmed, and no smell of fire had come upon them. <span id="calibre_link-1125" class="verse-num">28</span>Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. <span id="calibre_link-15480" class="verse-num">29</span>Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way." <span id="calibre_link-34899" class="verse-num">30</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-9558" class="heading">Daniel's Vision of the Ram and the Goat</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1985">DANIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 8 </span>In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first. <span id="calibre_link-34983" class="verse-num">2</span>And I saw in the vision; and when I saw, I was in Susa the citadel, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was at the Ulai canal. <span id="calibre_link-15375" class="verse-num">3</span>I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a ram standing on the bank of the canal. It had two horns, and both horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last. <span id="calibre_link-34984" class="verse-num">4</span>I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. No beast could stand before him, and there was no one who could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34985"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west across the face of the whole earth, without touching the ground. And the goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes. <span id="calibre_link-34986" class="verse-num">6</span>He came to the ram with the two horns, which I had seen standing on the bank of the canal, and he ran at him in his powerful wrath. <span id="calibre_link-34987" class="verse-num">7</span>I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged against him and struck the ram and broke his two horns. And the ram had no power to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled on him. And there was no one who could rescue the ram from his power. <span id="calibre_link-34988" class="verse-num">8</span>Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34989"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. <span id="calibre_link-34990" class="verse-num">10</span>It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them. <span id="calibre_link-34991" class="verse-num">11</span>It became great, even as great as the Prince of the host. And the regular burnt offering was taken away from him, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. <span id="calibre_link-34992" class="verse-num">12</span>And a host will be given over to it together with the regular burnt offering because of transgression, and it will throw truth to the ground, and it will act and prosper. <span id="calibre_link-34993" class="verse-num">13</span>Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, "For how long is the vision concerning the regular burnt offering, the transgression that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and host to be trampled underfoot?" <span id="calibre_link-34994" class="verse-num">14</span>And he said to me, "For 2,300 evenings and mornings.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. <span id="calibre_link-13817" class="verse-num">16</span>And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision." <span id="calibre_link-34996" class="verse-num">17</span>So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-34997"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up. <span id="calibre_link-10060" class="verse-num">19</span>He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end. <span id="calibre_link-8270" class="verse-num">20</span>As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. <span id="calibre_link-13982" class="verse-num">21</span>And the goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king. <span id="calibre_link-34998" class="verse-num">22</span>As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power. <span id="calibre_link-3943" class="verse-num">23</span>And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. <span id="calibre_link-34999" class="verse-num">24</span>His power shall be great&mdash;but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. <span id="calibre_link-35000" class="verse-num">25</span>By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great.
