When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. <span id="calibre_link-36216" class="verse-num">9</span>And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, <span id="calibre_link-10918" class="verse-num">10</span>for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. <span id="calibre_link-36217" class="verse-num">11</span>And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." <span id="calibre_link-36218" class="verse-num">12</span>And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-5000" class="heading">Jesus Anointed at Bethany</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. <span id="calibre_link-8811" class="verse-num">4</span>There were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the ointment wasted like that? <span id="calibre_link-36529" class="verse-num">5</span>For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor."

<p id="calibre_link-36533" class="heading">Judas to Betray Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. <span id="calibre_link-36534" class="verse-num">11</span>And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money.

<p id="calibre_link-36535" class="heading">The Passover with the Disciples</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?" <span id="calibre_link-36536" class="verse-num">13</span>And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, <span>"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.

<p id="calibre_link-13072" class="heading">Institution of the Lord's Supper</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, <span>"Take; this is my body."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36544" class="verse-num">23</span>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. <span id="calibre_link-8461" class="verse-num">24</span>And he said to them, <span>"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</span> <span id="calibre_link-36545" class="verse-num">25</span><span>Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-36546" class="heading">Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <span id="calibre_link-36547" class="verse-num">27</span>And Jesus said to them, <span>"You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'</span> <span id="calibre_link-36548" class="verse-num">28</span><span>But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36549" class="verse-num">29</span>Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall away, I will not." <span id="calibre_link-36550" class="verse-num">30</span>And Jesus said to him, <span>"Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36551" class="verse-num">31</span>But he said emphatically, "If I must die with you, I will not deny you."

<p id="calibre_link-36552" class="heading">Jesus Prays in Gethsemane</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>And they went to a place called Gethsemane.

Remain here and watch."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36555" class="verse-num">35</span>And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. <span id="calibre_link-9579" class="verse-num">36</span>And he said, <span>"Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36556" class="verse-num">37</span>And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, <span>"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?</span> <span id="calibre_link-36557" class="verse-num">38</span><span>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36558" class="verse-num">39</span>And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. <span id="calibre_link-36559" class="verse-num">40</span>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. <span id="calibre_link-12908" class="verse-num">41</span>And he came the third time and said to them, <span>"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?

<p id="calibre_link-36561" class="heading">Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">43</span>And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. <span id="calibre_link-36562" class="verse-num">44</span>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard." <span id="calibre_link-36563" class="verse-num">45</span>And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, "Rabbi!" And he kissed him. <span id="calibre_link-36564" class="verse-num">46</span>And they laid hands on him and seized him. <span id="calibre_link-36565" class="verse-num">47</span>But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. <span id="calibre_link-36566" class="verse-num">48</span>And Jesus said to them, <span>"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?</span> <span id="calibre_link-36567" class="verse-num">49</span><span>Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.

<p id="calibre_link-36569" class="heading">A Young Man Flees</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">51</span>And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, <span id="calibre_link-36570" class="verse-num">52</span>but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-36571" class="heading">Jesus Before the Council</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">53</span>And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. <span id="calibre_link-36572" class="verse-num">54</span>And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. <span id="calibre_link-36573" class="verse-num">55</span>Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. <span id="calibre_link-9799" class="verse-num">56</span>For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. <span id="calibre_link-36574" class="verse-num">57</span>And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, <span id="calibre_link-13089" class="verse-num">58</span>"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'" <span id="calibre_link-10785" class="verse-num">59</span>Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. <span id="calibre_link-36575" class="verse-num">60</span>And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?" <span id="calibre_link-36576" class="verse-num">61</span>But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" <span id="calibre_link-36577" class="verse-num">62</span>And Jesus said, <span>"I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36578" class="verse-num">63</span>And the high priest tore his garments and said, "What further witnesses do we need? <span id="calibre_link-36579" class="verse-num">64</span>You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving death. <span id="calibre_link-36580" class="verse-num">65</span>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" And the guards received him with blows.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-36581" class="heading">Peter Denies Jesus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">66</span>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, <span id="calibre_link-36582" class="verse-num">67</span>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus." <span id="calibre_link-36583" class="verse-num">68</span>But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. <span id="calibre_link-36584" class="verse-num">69</span>And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them." <span id="calibre_link-36585" class="verse-num">70</span>But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean." <span id="calibre_link-36586" class="verse-num">71</span>But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak." <span id="calibre_link-36587" class="verse-num">72</span>And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, <span>"Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."</span> And he broke down and wept.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-14850" class="heading">Jesus Delivered to Pilate</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1997">MARK</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 15 </span>And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. <span id="calibre_link-36588" class="verse-num">2</span>And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, <span>"You have said so."</span> <span id="calibre_link-36589" class="verse-num">3</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things. <span id="calibre_link-36590" class="verse-num">4</span>And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make?

<p id="calibre_link-36592" class="heading">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. <span id="calibre_link-36593" class="verse-num">7</span>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. <span id="calibre_link-36594" class="verse-num">8</span>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. <span id="calibre_link-36595" class="verse-num">9</span>And he answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?" <span id="calibre_link-36596" class="verse-num">10</span>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. <span id="calibre_link-36597" class="verse-num">11</span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. <span id="calibre_link-36598" class="verse-num">12</span>And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?" <span id="calibre_link-36599" class="verse-num">13</span>And they cried out again, "Crucify him." <span id="calibre_link-36600" class="verse-num">14</span>And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"

<p id="calibre_link-36602" class="heading">Jesus Is Mocked</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. <span id="calibre_link-36603" class="verse-num">17</span>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <span id="calibre_link-36604" class="verse-num">18</span>And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" <span id="calibre_link-36605" class="verse-num">19</span>And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. <span id="calibre_link-3140" class="verse-num">20</span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him.

<p id="calibre_link-36606" class="heading">The Crucifixion</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. <span id="calibre_link-36607" class="verse-num">22</span>And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). <span id="calibre_link-4749" class="verse-num">23</span>And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <span id="calibre_link-36608" class="verse-num">24</span>And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. <span id="calibre_link-36609" class="verse-num">25</span>And it was the third hour when they crucified him. <span id="calibre_link-36610" class="verse-num">26</span>And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews." <span id="calibre_link-15564" class="verse-num">27</span>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. <span id="calibre_link-36611" class="verse-num">29</span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, <span id="calibre_link-36612" class="verse-num">30</span>save yourself, and come down from the cross!" <span id="calibre_link-7128" class="verse-num">31</span>So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. <span id="calibre_link-36613" class="verse-num">32</span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe."
