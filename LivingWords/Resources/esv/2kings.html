<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1974">2 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9808"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25455" class="verse-num">3</span>But the angel of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? <span id="calibre_link-25456" class="verse-num">4</span>Now therefore thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; So Elijah went.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25457"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Why have you returned?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25458" class="verse-num">6</span>And they said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;There came a man to meet us, and said to us, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25459" class="verse-num">7</span>He said to them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25460" class="verse-num">8</span>They answered him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And he said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;It is Elijah the Tishbite.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25461"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;O man of God, the king says, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Come down.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25462" class="verse-num">10</span>But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, &acirc;&#128;&#156;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25463"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;O man of God, this is the king&acirc;&#128;&#153;s order, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Come down quickly!&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25464" class="verse-num">12</span>But Elijah answered them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12575"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight. <span id="calibre_link-25465" class="verse-num">14</span>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25466" class="verse-num">15</span>Then the angel of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> said to Elijah, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So he arose and went down with him to the king <span id="calibre_link-25467" class="verse-num">16</span>and said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron&mdash;is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?&mdash;therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25468"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>So he died according to the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son. <span id="calibre_link-25469" class="verse-num">18</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25474"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Then Elijah said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Please stay here, for the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has sent me to the Jordan.&acirc;&#128;&#157; But he said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;As the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So the two of them went on. <span id="calibre_link-25475" class="verse-num">7</span>Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan. <span id="calibre_link-25476" class="verse-num">8</span>Then Elijah took his cloak and rolled it up and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7718"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And Elisha said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25477" class="verse-num">10</span>And he said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you, but if you do not see me, it shall not be so.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-2968" class="verse-num">11</span>And as they still went on and talked, behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. <span id="calibre_link-25478" class="verse-num">12</span>And Elisha saw it and he cried, &acirc;&#128;&#156;My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!&acirc;&#128;&#157; And he saw him no more.</p>
<p class="crossway">Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. <span id="calibre_link-25479" class="verse-num">13</span>And he took up the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. <span id="calibre_link-25480" class="verse-num">14</span>Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the water, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Where is the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, the God of Elijah?&acirc;&#128;&#157; And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other, and Elisha went over.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13311" class="heading">Elisha Succeeds Elijah</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him opposite them, they said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him. <span id="calibre_link-25481" class="verse-num">16</span>And they said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. It may be that the Spirit of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And he said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You shall not send.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25482" class="verse-num">17</span>But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Send.&acirc;&#128;&#157; They sent therefore fifty men. And for three days they sought him but did not find him. <span id="calibre_link-25483" class="verse-num">18</span>And they came back to him while he was staying at Jericho, and he said to them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Did I not say to you, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Do not go&acirc;&#128;&#153;?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25484"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Now the men of the city said to Elisha, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees, but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25485" class="verse-num">20</span>He said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So they brought it to him. <span id="calibre_link-25486" class="verse-num">21</span>Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, I have healed this water; from now on neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25487" class="verse-num">22</span>So the water has been healed to this day, according to the word that Elisha spoke.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25488"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25489" class="verse-num">24</span>And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys. <span id="calibre_link-25490" class="verse-num">25</span>From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1974">2 KINGS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twelve years. <span id="calibre_link-25491" class="verse-num">2</span>He did what was evil in the sight of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, though not like his father and mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made. <span id="calibre_link-25492" class="verse-num">3</span>Nevertheless, he clung to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25493"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he had to deliver to the king of Israel 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams. <span id="calibre_link-25494" class="verse-num">5</span>But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-25495" class="verse-num">6</span>So King Jehoram marched out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. <span id="calibre_link-25496" class="verse-num">7</span>And he went and sent word to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The king of Moab has rebelled against me.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25498"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-25502"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, &acirc;&#128;&#156;What have I to do with you?

He will also give the Moabites into your hand, <span id="calibre_link-25508" class="verse-num">19</span>and you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree and stop up all springs of water and ruin every good piece of land with stones.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-25509" class="verse-num">20</span>The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.</p>

They stopped every spring of water and felled all the good trees, till only its stones were left in Kir-hareseth, and the slingers surrounded and attacked it. <span id="calibre_link-25515" class="verse-num">26</span>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him 700 swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom, but they could not. <span id="calibre_link-25516" class="verse-num">27</span>Then he took his oldest son who was to reign in his place and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall.
