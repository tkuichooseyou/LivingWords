<p id="calibre_link-10551" class="heading">Report from Jerusalem</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-953">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.</p>
<p class="crossway">Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the citadel, <span id="calibre_link-27939" class="verse-num">2</span>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. <span id="calibre_link-27940" class="verse-num">3</span>And they said to me, "The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-27941" class="heading">Nehemiah's Prayer</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. <span id="calibre_link-12533" class="verse-num">5</span>And I said, "O L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, <span id="calibre_link-27942" class="verse-num">6</span>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father's house have sinned. <span id="calibre_link-9718" class="verse-num">7</span>We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. <span id="calibre_link-27943" class="verse-num">8</span>Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples, <span id="calibre_link-15499" class="verse-num">9</span>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.' <span id="calibre_link-27944" class="verse-num">10</span>They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. <span id="calibre_link-7906" class="verse-num">11</span>O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."</p>
<p class="crossway">Now I was cupbearer to the king.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10139" class="heading">Nehemiah Sent to Judah</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-953">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence. <span id="calibre_link-27945" class="verse-num">2</span>And the king said to me, "Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of the heart." Then I was very much afraid. <span id="calibre_link-27946" class="verse-num">3</span>I said to the king, "Let the king live forever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' graves, lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?" <span id="calibre_link-27947" class="verse-num">4</span>Then the king said to me, "What are you requesting?" So I prayed to the God of heaven. <span id="calibre_link-27948" class="verse-num">5</span>And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' graves, that I may rebuild it." <span id="calibre_link-27949" class="verse-num">6</span>And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), "How long will you be gone, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me when I had given him a time. <span id="calibre_link-27950" class="verse-num">7</span>And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah, <span id="calibre_link-27951" class="verse-num">8</span>and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy." And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-27952" class="heading">Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Walls</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen. <span id="calibre_link-27953" class="verse-num">10</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant heard this, it displeased them greatly that someone had come to seek the welfare of the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1253"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>So I went to Jerusalem and was there three days. <span id="calibre_link-27954" class="verse-num">12</span>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. And I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me but the one on which I rode. <span id="calibre_link-27955" class="verse-num">13</span>I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Dragon Spring and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire. <span id="calibre_link-27956" class="verse-num">14</span>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but there was no room for the animal that was under me to pass. <span id="calibre_link-27957" class="verse-num">15</span>Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall, and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. <span id="calibre_link-27958" class="verse-num">16</span>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who were to do the work.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-11512"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer derision." <span id="calibre_link-27959" class="verse-num">18</span>And I told them of the hand of my God that had been upon me for good, and also of the words that the king had spoken to me. And they said, "Let us rise up and build." So they strengthened their hands for the good work. <span id="calibre_link-27960" class="verse-num">19</span>But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite servant and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they jeered at us and despised us and said, "What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?" <span id="calibre_link-8661" class="verse-num">20</span>Then I replied to them, "The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or claim in Jerusalem."</p>

<p id="calibre_link-10553" class="heading">Opposition to the Work</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-953">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span> Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he jeered at the Jews. <span id="calibre_link-12221" class="verse-num">2</span>And he said in the presence of his brothers and of the army of Samaria, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?" <span id="calibre_link-27991" class="verse-num">3</span>Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, "Yes, what they are building&mdash;if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!" <span id="calibre_link-27992" class="verse-num">4</span>Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives. <span id="calibre_link-27993" class="verse-num">5</span>Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-11740"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-27994"> <span class="verse-num">7</span> But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry. <span id="calibre_link-27995" class="verse-num">8</span>And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it. <span id="calibre_link-27996" class="verse-num">9</span>And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-27997"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>In Judah it was said, "The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble. By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall." <span id="calibre_link-27998" class="verse-num">11</span>And our enemies said, "They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work." <span id="calibre_link-27999" class="verse-num">12</span>At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times, "You must return to us." <span id="calibre_link-28000" class="verse-num">13</span>So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people by their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. <span id="calibre_link-4050" class="verse-num">14</span>And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8364" class="heading">The Work Resumes</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. <span id="calibre_link-28001" class="verse-num">16</span>From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. And the leaders stood behind the whole house of Judah, <span id="calibre_link-28002" class="verse-num">17</span>who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were loaded in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and held his weapon with the other. <span id="calibre_link-28003" class="verse-num">18</span>And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me. <span id="calibre_link-28004" class="verse-num">19</span>And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another. <span id="calibre_link-12243" class="verse-num">20</span>In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28005"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out. <span id="calibre_link-28006" class="verse-num">22</span>I also said to the people at that time, "Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day." <span id="calibre_link-28007" class="verse-num">23</span>So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon at his right hand.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10554" class="heading">Nehemiah Stops Oppression of the Poor</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-953">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 5 </span>Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers. <span id="calibre_link-28008" class="verse-num">2</span>For there were those who said, "With our sons and our daughters, we are many. So let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive." <span id="calibre_link-28009" class="verse-num">3</span>There were also those who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine." <span id="calibre_link-28010" class="verse-num">4</span>And there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax on our fields and our vineyards. <span id="calibre_link-28011" class="verse-num">5</span>Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children are as their children. Yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28012"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. <span id="calibre_link-28013" class="verse-num">7</span>I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, "You are exacting interest, each from his brother." And I held a great assembly against them <span id="calibre_link-28014" class="verse-num">8</span>and said to them, "We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brothers who have been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us!" They were silent and could not find a word to say. <span id="calibre_link-28015" class="verse-num">9</span>So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies? <span id="calibre_link-28016" class="verse-num">10</span>Moreover, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us abandon this exacting of interest. <span id="calibre_link-28017" class="verse-num">11</span>Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the percentage of money, grain, wine, and oil that you have been exacting from them." <span id="calibre_link-28018" class="verse-num">12</span>Then they said, "We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say." And I called the priests and made them swear to do as they had promised. <span id="calibre_link-10198" class="verse-num">13</span>I also shook out the fold of my garment and said, "So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not keep this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said "Amen" and praised the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. And the people did as they had promised.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10140" class="heading">Nehemiah's Generosity</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food allowance of the governor. <span id="calibre_link-28019" class="verse-num">15</span>The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people and took from them for their daily ration forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God. <span id="calibre_link-28020" class="verse-num">16</span>I also persevered in the work on this wall, and we acquired no land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work. <span id="calibre_link-28021" class="verse-num">17</span>Moreover, there were at my table 150 men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us. <span id="calibre_link-28022" class="verse-num">18</span>Now what was prepared at my expense for each day was one ox and six choice sheep and birds, and every ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. Yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the service was too heavy on this people. <span id="calibre_link-28023" class="verse-num">19</span>Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10555" class="heading">Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-953">NEHEMIAH</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 6 </span>Now when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), <span id="calibre_link-28024" class="verse-num">2</span>Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet together at Hakkephirim in the plain of Ono." But they intended to do me harm. <span id="calibre_link-28025" class="verse-num">3</span>And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?" <span id="calibre_link-28026" class="verse-num">4</span>And they sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner. <span id="calibre_link-28027" class="verse-num">5</span>In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand. <span id="calibre_link-28028" class="verse-num">6</span>In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall. And according to these reports you wish to become their king. <span id="calibre_link-28029" class="verse-num">7</span>And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, 'There is a king in Judah.' And now the king will hear of these reports. So now come and let us take counsel together." <span id="calibre_link-28030" class="verse-num">8</span>Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind." <span id="calibre_link-28031" class="verse-num">9</span>For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen my hands.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28032"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28280"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>I also found out that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled each to his field. <span id="calibre_link-28281" class="verse-num">11</span>So I confronted the officials and said, "Why is the house of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together and set them in their stations. <span id="calibre_link-28282" class="verse-num">12</span>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses. <span id="calibre_link-28283" class="verse-num">13</span>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, and as their assistant Hanan the son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered reliable, and their duty was to distribute to their brothers. <span id="calibre_link-28284" class="verse-num">14</span>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God and for his service.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28285"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>In those days I saw in Judah people treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on donkeys, and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them on the day when they sold food. <span id="calibre_link-28286" class="verse-num">16</span>Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself! <span id="calibre_link-28287" class="verse-num">17</span>Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? <span id="calibre_link-28288" class="verse-num">18</span>Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28289"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day. <span id="calibre_link-28290" class="verse-num">20</span>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. <span id="calibre_link-28291" class="verse-num">21</span>But I warned them and said to them, "Why do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. <span id="calibre_link-28292" class="verse-num">22</span>Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28293"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. <span id="calibre_link-28294" class="verse-num">24</span>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people. <span id="calibre_link-28295" class="verse-num">25</span>And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. And I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. <span id="calibre_link-28296" class="verse-num">26</span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin. <span id="calibre_link-28297" class="verse-num">27</span>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28298"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me. <span id="calibre_link-28299" class="verse-num">29</span>Remember them, O my God, because they have desecrated the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-28300"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work; <span id="calibre_link-28301" class="verse-num">31</span>and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times, and for the firstfruits.</p>
<p class="crossway">Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>
