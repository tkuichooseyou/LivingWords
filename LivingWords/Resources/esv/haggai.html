<p id="calibre_link-130" class="heading">The Command to Rebuild the Temple</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1994">HAGGAI</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: <span id="calibre_link-35610" class="verse-num">2</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35611" class="verse-num">3</span>Then the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, <span id="calibre_link-35612" class="verse-num">4</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? <span id="calibre_link-3380" class="verse-num">5</span>Now, therefore, thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts: Consider your ways. <span id="calibre_link-12710" class="verse-num">6</span>You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-35613"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts: Consider your ways. <span id="calibre_link-35614" class="verse-num">8</span>Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-35615" class="verse-num">9</span>You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. <span id="calibre_link-35616" class="verse-num">10</span>Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. <span id="calibre_link-35617" class="verse-num">11</span>And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-35618" class="heading">The People Obey the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> their God had sent him. And the people feared the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-35619" class="verse-num">13</span>Then Haggai, the messenger of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, spoke to the people with the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>&acirc;&#128;&#153;s message, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I am with you, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35620" class="verse-num">14</span>And the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts, their God, <span id="calibre_link-35621" class="verse-num">15</span>on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-2422" class="heading">The Coming Glory of the Temple</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1994">HAGGAI</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, <span id="calibre_link-35622" class="verse-num">2</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say, <span id="calibre_link-35623" class="verse-num">3</span>&acirc;&#128;&#152;Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? <span id="calibre_link-35624" class="verse-num">4</span>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. Be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. Work, for I am with you, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts, <span id="calibre_link-35625" class="verse-num">5</span>according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit remains in your midst. Fear not. <span id="calibre_link-35626" class="verse-num">6</span>For thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts: Yet once more, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land. <span id="calibre_link-12249" class="verse-num">7</span>And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts. <span id="calibre_link-7461" class="verse-num">8</span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts. <span id="calibre_link-35627" class="verse-num">9</span>The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-35628" class="heading">Blessings for a Defiled People</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came by Haggai the prophet, <span id="calibre_link-35629" class="verse-num">11</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Thus says the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts: Ask the priests about the law: <span id="calibre_link-35630" class="verse-num">12</span>&acirc;&#128;&#152;If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; The priests answered and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;No.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35631" class="verse-num">13</span>Then Haggai said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?&acirc;&#128;&#157; The priests answered and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;It does become unclean.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-35632" class="verse-num">14</span>Then Haggai answered and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean. <span id="calibre_link-35633" class="verse-num">15</span>Now then, consider from this day onward. Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, <span id="calibre_link-35634" class="verse-num">16</span>how did you fare? When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty. <span id="calibre_link-35635" class="verse-num">17</span>I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail, yet you did not turn to me, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-35636" class="verse-num">18</span>Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>&acirc;&#128;&#153;s temple was laid, consider: <span id="calibre_link-35637" class="verse-num">19</span>Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on I will bless you.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-35638" class="heading">Zerubbabel Chosen as a Signet</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>The word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, <span id="calibre_link-35639" class="verse-num">21</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth, <span id="calibre_link-35640" class="verse-num">22</span>and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his brother. <span id="calibre_link-35641" class="verse-num">23</span>On that day, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel my servant, the son of Shealtiel, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, and make you like a signet ring, for I have chosen you, declares the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
