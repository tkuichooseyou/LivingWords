<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7001"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38356"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38357" class="heading">Thanksgiving</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus, <span id="calibre_link-13352" class="verse-num">5</span>that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-3353" class="verse-num">6</span>even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-11488" class="verse-num">7</span>so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span id="calibre_link-7960" class="verse-num">8</span>who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-12232" class="verse-num">9</span>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-789" class="heading">Divisions in the Church</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. <span id="calibre_link-38358" class="verse-num">11</span>For it has been reported to me by Chloe&acirc;&#128;&#153;s people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. <span id="calibre_link-2932" class="verse-num">12</span>What I mean is that each one of you says, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Paul,&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Apollos,&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Cephas,&acirc;&#128;&#157; or &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Christ.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-774" class="verse-num">13</span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul? <span id="calibre_link-38359" class="verse-num">14</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius, <span id="calibre_link-38360" class="verse-num">15</span>so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name. <span id="calibre_link-38361" class="verse-num">16</span>(I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.) <span id="calibre_link-3580" class="verse-num">17</span>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3581" class="heading">Christ the Wisdom and Power of God</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <span id="calibre_link-38362" class="verse-num">19</span>For it is written,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11669" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? <span id="calibre_link-8399" class="verse-num">21</span>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. <span id="calibre_link-1316" class="verse-num">22</span>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom, <span id="calibre_link-3607" class="verse-num">23</span>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, <span id="calibre_link-38363" class="verse-num">24</span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. <span id="calibre_link-11565" class="verse-num">25</span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-2808"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. <span id="calibre_link-7337" class="verse-num">27</span>But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; <span id="calibre_link-513" class="verse-num">28</span>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, <span id="calibre_link-12845" class="verse-num">29</span>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. <span id="calibre_link-6995" class="verse-num">30</span>And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, <span id="calibre_link-12996" class="verse-num">31</span>so that, as it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7707" class="heading">Proclaiming Christ Crucified</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom. <span id="calibre_link-38364" class="verse-num">2</span>For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. <span id="calibre_link-38365" class="verse-num">3</span>And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling, <span id="calibre_link-38366" class="verse-num">4</span>and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, <span id="calibre_link-12151" class="verse-num">5</span>so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4455" class="heading">Wisdom from the Spirit</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away. <span id="calibre_link-324" class="verse-num">7</span>But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. <span id="calibre_link-15609" class="verse-num">8</span>None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. <span id="calibre_link-8546" class="verse-num">9</span>But, as it is written,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,</p>
<p class="line-indent">nor the heart of man imagined,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">what God has prepared for those who love him&acirc;&#128;&#157;&mdash;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-458" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. <span id="calibre_link-38367" class="verse-num">11</span>For who knows a person&acirc;&#128;&#153;s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. <span id="calibre_link-13880" class="verse-num">12</span>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. <span id="calibre_link-7738" class="verse-num">13</span>And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-660"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. <span id="calibre_link-38368" class="verse-num">15</span>The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. <span id="calibre_link-4571" class="verse-num">16</span>&acirc;&#128;&#156;For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?&acirc;&#128;&#157; But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-14681" class="heading">Divisions in the Church</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. <span id="calibre_link-4562" class="verse-num">2</span>I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready, <span id="calibre_link-1208" class="verse-num">3</span>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way? <span id="calibre_link-38369" class="verse-num">4</span>For when one says, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Paul,&acirc;&#128;&#157; and another, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I follow Apollos,&acirc;&#128;&#157; are you not being merely human?</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8200"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. <span id="calibre_link-8379" class="verse-num">6</span>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. <span id="calibre_link-11555" class="verse-num">7</span>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. <span id="calibre_link-3672" class="verse-num">8</span>He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. <span id="calibre_link-11753" class="verse-num">9</span>For we are God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s fellow workers. You are God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s field, God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s building.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-2856"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it. <span id="calibre_link-3788" class="verse-num">11</span>For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-7821" class="verse-num">12</span>Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-192" class="verse-num">13</span>each one&acirc;&#128;&#153;s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. <span id="calibre_link-38370" class="verse-num">14</span>If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. <span id="calibre_link-4075" class="verse-num">15</span>If anyone&acirc;&#128;&#153;s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-947"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Do you not know that you are God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s temple and that God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Spirit dwells in you? <span id="calibre_link-538" class="verse-num">17</span>If anyone destroys God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s temple, God will destroy him. For God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-295"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. <span id="calibre_link-3528" class="verse-num">19</span>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;He catches the wise in their craftiness,&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-10833" class="verse-num">20</span>and again, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38371" class="verse-num">21</span>So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, <span id="calibre_link-8553" class="verse-num">22</span>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future&mdash;all are yours, <span id="calibre_link-38372" class="verse-num">23</span>and you are Christ&acirc;&#128;&#153;s, and Christ is God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4752" class="heading">The Ministry of Apostles</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. <span id="calibre_link-7785" class="verse-num">2</span>Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. <span id="calibre_link-38373" class="verse-num">3</span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. <span id="calibre_link-1444" class="verse-num">4</span>For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. <span id="calibre_link-3268" class="verse-num">5</span>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart.

And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you! <span id="calibre_link-38376" class="verse-num">9</span>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men. <span id="calibre_link-12328" class="verse-num">10</span>We are fools for Christ&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sake, but you are wise in Christ.

When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; <span id="calibre_link-7550" class="verse-num">13</span>when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9728"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children. <span id="calibre_link-12193" class="verse-num">15</span>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. <span id="calibre_link-38377" class="verse-num">16</span>I urge you, then, be imitators of me. <span id="calibre_link-38378" class="verse-num">17</span>That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. <span id="calibre_link-38379" class="verse-num">18</span>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. <span id="calibre_link-38380" class="verse-num">19</span>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power. <span id="calibre_link-10675" class="verse-num">20</span>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power. <span id="calibre_link-15579" class="verse-num">21</span>What do you wish?

For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4422"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband <span id="calibre_link-793" class="verse-num">11</span>(but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-16971"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. <span id="calibre_link-794" class="verse-num">13</span>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. <span id="calibre_link-16974" class="verse-num">14</span>For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <span id="calibre_link-7264" class="verse-num">15</span>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. <span id="calibre_link-38388" class="verse-num">16</span>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?

<p id="calibre_link-3907" class="heading">Live as You Are Called</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches. <span id="calibre_link-4414" class="verse-num">18</span>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. <span id="calibre_link-3261" class="verse-num">19</span>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. <span id="calibre_link-15455" class="verse-num">20</span>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. <span id="calibre_link-4953" class="verse-num">21</span>Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) <span id="calibre_link-38389" class="verse-num">22</span>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ. <span id="calibre_link-8569" class="verse-num">23</span>You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. <span id="calibre_link-38390" class="verse-num">24</span>So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12911" class="heading">The Unmarried and the Widowed</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord&acirc;&#128;&#153;s mercy is trustworthy. <span id="calibre_link-38391" class="verse-num">26</span>I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. <span id="calibre_link-38392" class="verse-num">27</span>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <span id="calibre_link-4426" class="verse-num">28</span>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <span id="calibre_link-38393" class="verse-num">29</span>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <span id="calibre_link-13107" class="verse-num">30</span>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <span id="calibre_link-8176" class="verse-num">31</span>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8393"> <span class="verse-num">32</span>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-4423" class="verse-num">33</span>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <span id="calibre_link-9142" class="verse-num">34</span>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <span id="calibre_link-16995" class="verse-num">35</span>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38394"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry&mdash;it is no sin. <span id="calibre_link-486" class="verse-num">37</span>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <span id="calibre_link-4418" class="verse-num">38</span>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15915"> <span class="verse-num">39</span>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-38395" class="verse-num">40</span>Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is.

<p id="calibre_link-13012" class="heading">One Body with Many Members</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. <span id="calibre_link-882" class="verse-num">13</span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body&mdash;Jews or Greeks, slaves or free&mdash;and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38421"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>For the body does not consist of one member but of many. <span id="calibre_link-12330" class="verse-num">15</span>If the foot should say, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,&acirc;&#128;&#157; that would not make it any less a part of the body. <span id="calibre_link-13253" class="verse-num">16</span>And if the ear should say, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,&acirc;&#128;&#157; that would not make it any less a part of the body. <span id="calibre_link-11601" class="verse-num">17</span>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? <span id="calibre_link-4502" class="verse-num">18</span>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. <span id="calibre_link-38422" class="verse-num">19</span>If all were a single member, where would the body be? <span id="calibre_link-38423" class="verse-num">20</span>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38424"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>The eye cannot say to the hand, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have no need of you,&acirc;&#128;&#157; nor again the head to the feet, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have no need of you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-11564" class="verse-num">22</span>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <span id="calibre_link-4627" class="verse-num">23</span>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, <span id="calibre_link-38425" class="verse-num">24</span>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, <span id="calibre_link-786" class="verse-num">25</span>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. <span id="calibre_link-7929" class="verse-num">26</span>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13013"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. <span id="calibre_link-8655" class="verse-num">28</span>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. <span id="calibre_link-10704" class="verse-num">29</span>Are all apostles?

<p id="calibre_link-3661" class="heading">The Way of Love</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 13 </span>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. <span id="calibre_link-4696" class="verse-num">2</span>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <span id="calibre_link-13101" class="verse-num">3</span>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4102"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant <span id="calibre_link-38426" class="verse-num">5</span>or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; <span id="calibre_link-11029" class="verse-num">6</span>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. <span id="calibre_link-12797" class="verse-num">7</span>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8628"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. <span id="calibre_link-8161" class="verse-num">9</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <span id="calibre_link-8172" class="verse-num">10</span>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. <span id="calibre_link-2994" class="verse-num">11</span>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. <span id="calibre_link-4602" class="verse-num">12</span>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4103"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8641" class="heading">Prophecy and Tongues</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 14 </span>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. <span id="calibre_link-10901" class="verse-num">2</span>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. <span id="calibre_link-3383" class="verse-num">3</span>On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. <span id="calibre_link-3064" class="verse-num">4</span>The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. <span id="calibre_link-10908" class="verse-num">5</span>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38427"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? <span id="calibre_link-38428" class="verse-num">7</span>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? <span id="calibre_link-12790" class="verse-num">8</span>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? <span id="calibre_link-38429" class="verse-num">9</span>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. <span id="calibre_link-38430" class="verse-num">10</span>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, <span id="calibre_link-3729" class="verse-num">11</span>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. <span id="calibre_link-13092" class="verse-num">12</span>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38431"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. <span id="calibre_link-8503" class="verse-num">14</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. <span id="calibre_link-7492" class="verse-num">15</span>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <span id="calibre_link-38432" class="verse-num">16</span>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say &acirc;&#128;&#156;Amen&acirc;&#128;&#157; to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <span id="calibre_link-38433" class="verse-num">17</span>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <span id="calibre_link-38434" class="verse-num">18</span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <span id="calibre_link-9122" class="verse-num">19</span>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4456"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. <span id="calibre_link-38435" class="verse-num">21</span>In the Law it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-8632" class="verse-num">22</span>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. <span id="calibre_link-8863" class="verse-num">23</span>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? <span id="calibre_link-16972" class="verse-num">24</span>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, <span id="calibre_link-694" class="verse-num">25</span>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3202" class="heading">Orderly Worship</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. <span id="calibre_link-38436" class="verse-num">27</span>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. <span id="calibre_link-7456" class="verse-num">28</span>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. <span id="calibre_link-38437" class="verse-num">29</span>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. <span id="calibre_link-38438" class="verse-num">30</span>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. <span id="calibre_link-13318" class="verse-num">31</span>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, <span id="calibre_link-8656" class="verse-num">32</span>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. <span id="calibre_link-3072" class="verse-num">33</span>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</p>
<p class="crossway">As in all the churches of the saints, <span id="calibre_link-7890" class="verse-num">34</span>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. <span id="calibre_link-10189" class="verse-num">35</span>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38439"> <span class="verse-num">36</span>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? <span id="calibre_link-8648" class="verse-num">37</span>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-38440" class="verse-num">38</span>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. <span id="calibre_link-8642" class="verse-num">39</span>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <span id="calibre_link-38441" class="verse-num">40</span>But all things should be done decently and in order.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-998">1 CORINTHIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 15 </span>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, <span id="calibre_link-11730" class="verse-num">2</span>and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you&mdash;unless you believed in vain.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-605"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, <span id="calibre_link-13098" class="verse-num">4</span>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, <span id="calibre_link-2933" class="verse-num">5</span>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. <span id="calibre_link-10196" class="verse-num">6</span>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. <span id="calibre_link-38442" class="verse-num">7</span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. <span id="calibre_link-10043" class="verse-num">8</span>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. <span id="calibre_link-3824" class="verse-num">9</span>For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <span id="calibre_link-13955" class="verse-num">10</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain.

<p id="calibre_link-38444" class="heading">The Resurrection of the Dead</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <span id="calibre_link-38445" class="verse-num">13</span>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <span id="calibre_link-1772" class="verse-num">14</span>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. <span id="calibre_link-10777" class="verse-num">15</span>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. <span id="calibre_link-223" class="verse-num">16</span>For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. <span id="calibre_link-12412" class="verse-num">17</span>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. <span id="calibre_link-8254" class="verse-num">18</span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. <span id="calibre_link-8343" class="verse-num">19</span>If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3045"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <span id="calibre_link-38446" class="verse-num">21</span>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. <span id="calibre_link-9721" class="verse-num">22</span>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. <span id="calibre_link-3231" class="verse-num">23</span>But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. <span id="calibre_link-395" class="verse-num">24</span>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power. <span id="calibre_link-13337" class="verse-num">25</span>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <span id="calibre_link-13342" class="verse-num">26</span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <span id="calibre_link-7888" class="verse-num">27</span>For &acirc;&#128;&#156;God has put all things in subjection under his feet.&acirc;&#128;&#157; But when it says, &acirc;&#128;&#156;all things are put in subjection,&acirc;&#128;&#157; it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him. <span id="calibre_link-7638" class="verse-num">28</span>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
