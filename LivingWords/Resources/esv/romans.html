<p id="calibre_link-10011" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2000">ROMANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, <span id="calibre_link-7142" class="verse-num">2</span>which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, <span id="calibre_link-38256" class="verse-num">3</span>concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh <span id="calibre_link-38257" class="verse-num">4</span>and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <span id="calibre_link-8769" class="verse-num">5</span>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, <span id="calibre_link-38258" class="verse-num">6</span>including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-6944"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:</p>
<p class="crossway">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11769" class="heading">Longing to Go to Rome</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. <span id="calibre_link-38259" class="verse-num">9</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you <span id="calibre_link-38260" class="verse-num">10</span>always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. <span id="calibre_link-38261" class="verse-num">11</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-38262" class="verse-num">12</span>that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other&acirc;&#128;&#153;s faith, both yours and mine. <span id="calibre_link-5831" class="verse-num">13</span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. <span id="calibre_link-8780" class="verse-num">14</span>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. <span id="calibre_link-8519" class="verse-num">15</span>So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1303" class="heading">The Righteous Shall Live by Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. <span id="calibre_link-12149" class="verse-num">17</span>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The righteous shall live by faith.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11028" class="heading">God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Wrath on Unrighteousness</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. <span id="calibre_link-8362" class="verse-num">19</span>For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. <span id="calibre_link-5027" class="verse-num">20</span>For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. <span id="calibre_link-137" class="verse-num">21</span>For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <span id="calibre_link-11674" class="verse-num">22</span>Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <span id="calibre_link-9040" class="verse-num">23</span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9056"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, <span id="calibre_link-3552" class="verse-num">25</span>because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-715"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; <span id="calibre_link-913" class="verse-num">27</span>and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-271"> <span class="verse-num">28</span>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. <span id="calibre_link-286" class="verse-num">29</span>They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <span id="calibre_link-727" class="verse-num">30</span>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <span id="calibre_link-15831" class="verse-num">31</span>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <span id="calibre_link-10067" class="verse-num">32</span>Though they know God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13438" class="heading">God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Righteous Judgment</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2000">ROMANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. <span id="calibre_link-38263" class="verse-num">2</span>We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. <span id="calibre_link-13389" class="verse-num">3</span>Do you suppose, O man&mdash;you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself&mdash;that you will escape the judgment of God? <span id="calibre_link-3803" class="verse-num">4</span>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? <span id="calibre_link-1453" class="verse-num">5</span>But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s righteous judgment will be revealed.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15472"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>He will render to each one according to his works: <span id="calibre_link-8193" class="verse-num">7</span>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; <span id="calibre_link-8774" class="verse-num">8</span>but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. <span id="calibre_link-12844" class="verse-num">9</span>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, <span id="calibre_link-38264" class="verse-num">10</span>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. <span id="calibre_link-8167" class="verse-num">11</span>For God shows no partiality.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1437" class="heading">God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Judgment and the Law</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. <span id="calibre_link-806" class="verse-num">13</span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. <span id="calibre_link-38265" class="verse-num">14</span>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. <span id="calibre_link-3364" class="verse-num">15</span>They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them <span id="calibre_link-1443" class="verse-num">16</span>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38266"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God <span id="calibre_link-9124" class="verse-num">18</span>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; <span id="calibre_link-12979" class="verse-num">19</span>and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, <span id="calibre_link-38267" class="verse-num">20</span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-7779" class="verse-num">21</span>you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? <span id="calibre_link-9024" class="verse-num">22</span>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <span id="calibre_link-713" class="verse-num">23</span>You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. <span id="calibre_link-12948" class="verse-num">24</span>For, as it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-16980"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. <span id="calibre_link-38268" class="verse-num">26</span>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? <span id="calibre_link-16979" class="verse-num">27</span>Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. <span id="calibre_link-8869" class="verse-num">28</span>For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. <span id="calibre_link-1304" class="verse-num">29</span>But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1305" class="heading">God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Righteousness Upheld</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2000">ROMANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? <span id="calibre_link-8853" class="verse-num">2</span>Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. <span id="calibre_link-5142" class="verse-num">3</span>What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? <span id="calibre_link-3879" class="verse-num">4</span>By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;That you may be justified in your words,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and prevail when you are judged.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-17003" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) <span id="calibre_link-38269" class="verse-num">6</span>By no means! For then how could God judge the world? <span id="calibre_link-38270" class="verse-num">7</span>But if through my lie God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? <span id="calibre_link-38271" class="verse-num">8</span>And why not do evil that good may come?&mdash;as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38272" class="heading">No One Is Righteous</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, <span id="calibre_link-5131" class="verse-num">10</span>as it is written:</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;None is righteous, no, not one;</p>
<p class="line-indent"><span id="calibre_link-7224" class="verse-num">11</span> no one understands;</p>
<p class="line-indent">no one seeks for God.</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-10179" class="verse-num">12</span> All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;</p>
<p class="line-indent">no one does good,</p>
<p class="line-indent">not even one.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-10842" class="verse-num">13</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Their throat is an open grave;</p>
<p class="line-indent">they use their tongues to deceive.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">&acirc;&#128;&#156;The venom of asps is under their lips.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="line-indent"><span id="calibre_link-3651" class="verse-num">14</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-7355" class="verse-num">15</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Their feet are swift to shed blood;</p>
<p class="line-indent"><span id="calibre_link-4608" class="verse-num">16</span> in their paths are ruin and misery,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-38273" class="verse-num">17</span> and the way of peace they have not known.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="line-indent"><span id="calibre_link-12207" class="verse-num">18</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;There is no fear of God before their eyes.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9693" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. <span id="calibre_link-38274" class="verse-num">20</span>For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38275" class="heading">The Righteousness of God Through Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-754" class="verse-num">22</span>the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: <span id="calibre_link-7409" class="verse-num">23</span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, <span id="calibre_link-1495" class="verse-num">24</span>and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, <span id="calibre_link-779" class="verse-num">25</span>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. <span id="calibre_link-1471" class="verse-num">26</span>It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13001"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. <span id="calibre_link-1496" class="verse-num">28</span>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. <span id="calibre_link-1315" class="verse-num">29</span>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, <span id="calibre_link-1510" class="verse-num">30</span>since God is one&mdash;who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. <span id="calibre_link-8877" class="verse-num">31</span>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-13592" class="heading">Abraham Justified by Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2000">ROMANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? <span id="calibre_link-1497" class="verse-num">2</span>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. <span id="calibre_link-9647" class="verse-num">3</span>For what does the Scripture say? &acirc;&#128;&#156;Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38276" class="verse-num">4</span>Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. <span id="calibre_link-1507" class="verse-num">5</span>And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness, <span id="calibre_link-38277" class="verse-num">6</span>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3518" class="line-group"> <span class="verse-num">7</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,</p>
<p class="line-indent">and whose sins are covered;</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-3466" class="verse-num">8</span> blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-15541" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness. <span id="calibre_link-38278" class="verse-num">10</span>How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. <span id="calibre_link-3085" class="verse-num">11</span>He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well, <span id="calibre_link-38279" class="verse-num">12</span>and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38280" class="heading">The Promise Realized Through Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. <span id="calibre_link-1862" class="verse-num">14</span>For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void. <span id="calibre_link-3760" class="verse-num">15</span>For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-444"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring&mdash;not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, <span id="calibre_link-3906" class="verse-num">17</span>as it is written, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have made you the father of many nations&acirc;&#128;&#157;&mdash;in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist. <span id="calibre_link-38281" class="verse-num">18</span>In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, &acirc;&#128;&#156;So shall your offspring be.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38282" class="verse-num">19</span>He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah&acirc;&#128;&#153;s womb. <span id="calibre_link-38283" class="verse-num">20</span>No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, <span id="calibre_link-3430" class="verse-num">21</span>fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. <span id="calibre_link-3469" class="verse-num">22</span>That is why his faith was &acirc;&#128;&#156;counted to him as righteousness.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38284" class="verse-num">23</span>But the words &acirc;&#128;&#156;it was counted to him&acirc;&#128;&#157; were not written for his sake alone, <span id="calibre_link-221" class="verse-num">24</span>but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, <span id="calibre_link-387" class="verse-num">25</span>who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1498" class="heading">Peace with God Through Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2000">ROMANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 5 </span>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-7761" class="verse-num">2</span>Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. <span id="calibre_link-7922" class="verse-num">3</span>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, <span id="calibre_link-2958" class="verse-num">4</span>and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, <span id="calibre_link-7335" class="verse-num">5</span>and hope does not put us to shame, because God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-603"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. <span id="calibre_link-127" class="verse-num">7</span>For one will scarcely die for a righteous person&mdash;though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-3041" class="verse-num">8</span>but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. <span id="calibre_link-11803" class="verse-num">9</span>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. <span id="calibre_link-255" class="verse-num">10</span>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. <span id="calibre_link-15410" class="verse-num">11</span>More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4379" class="heading">Death in Adam, Life in Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-38285" class="verse-num">13</span>for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. <span id="calibre_link-4671" class="verse-num">14</span>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9634"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man&acirc;&#128;&#153;s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many. <span id="calibre_link-10977" class="verse-num">16</span>And the free gift is not like the result of that one man&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sin.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-1491"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. <span id="calibre_link-723" class="verse-num">19</span>For as by the one man&acirc;&#128;&#153;s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man&acirc;&#128;&#153;s obedience the many will be made righteous. <span id="calibre_link-3761" class="verse-num">20</span>Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, <span id="calibre_link-13400" class="verse-num">21</span>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12794"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God. <span id="calibre_link-7490" class="verse-num">5</span>For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. <span id="calibre_link-2841" class="verse-num">6</span>But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38292" class="heading">The Law and Sin</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38295"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. <span id="calibre_link-7613" class="verse-num">14</span>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. <span id="calibre_link-11522" class="verse-num">15</span>For I do not understand my own actions.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15525"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. <span id="calibre_link-372" class="verse-num">22</span>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, <span id="calibre_link-11527" class="verse-num">23</span>but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. <span id="calibre_link-11805" class="verse-num">24</span>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? <span id="calibre_link-4569" class="verse-num">25</span>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
