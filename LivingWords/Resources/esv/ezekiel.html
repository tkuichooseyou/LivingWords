<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1984">EZEKIEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the Chebar canal, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. <span id="calibre_link-33689" class="verse-num">2</span>On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin), <span id="calibre_link-13460" class="verse-num">3</span>the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the Chebar canal, and the hand of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> was upon him there.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-33690" class="heading">The Glory of the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal. <span id="calibre_link-3560" class="verse-num">5</span>And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness, <span id="calibre_link-12135" class="verse-num">6</span>but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. <span id="calibre_link-33691" class="verse-num">7</span>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot. And they sparkled like burnished bronze. <span id="calibre_link-33692" class="verse-num">8</span>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: <span id="calibre_link-33693" class="verse-num">9</span>their wings touched one another. Each one of them went straight forward, without turning as they went. <span id="calibre_link-8889" class="verse-num">10</span>As for the likeness of their faces, each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle. <span id="calibre_link-3556" class="verse-num">11</span>Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. <span id="calibre_link-33694" class="verse-num">12</span>And each went straight forward. Wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. <span id="calibre_link-33695" class="verse-num">13</span>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. <span id="calibre_link-33696" class="verse-num">14</span>And the living creatures darted to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33697"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. <span id="calibre_link-33698" class="verse-num">16</span>As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl. And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. <span id="calibre_link-33699" class="verse-num">17</span>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. <span id="calibre_link-13454" class="verse-num">18</span>And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. <span id="calibre_link-33700" class="verse-num">19</span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. <span id="calibre_link-33701" class="verse-num">20</span>Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <span id="calibre_link-33702" class="verse-num">21</span>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-3627"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads. <span id="calibre_link-33703" class="verse-num">23</span>And under the expanse their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another. And each creature had two wings covering its body. <span id="calibre_link-9842" class="verse-num">24</span>And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings. <span id="calibre_link-33704" class="verse-num">25</span>And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7022"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance. <span id="calibre_link-33705" class="verse-num">27</span>And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. <span id="calibre_link-33706" class="verse-num">28</span>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.</p>
<p class="crossway">Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9474" class="heading">Ezekiel's Call</p>

Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.</p>

Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. <span id="calibre_link-33718" class="verse-num">7</span>But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. <span id="calibre_link-33719" class="verse-num">8</span>Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. <span id="calibre_link-33720" class="verse-num">9</span>Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house." <span id="calibre_link-33721" class="verse-num">10</span>Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears. <span id="calibre_link-33722" class="verse-num">11</span>And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord G<span class="calibre11">OD</span>,' whether they hear or refuse to hear."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33723"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great earthquake: "Blessed be the glory of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> from its place!" <span id="calibre_link-33724" class="verse-num">13</span>It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake. <span id="calibre_link-33725" class="verse-num">14</span>The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> being strong upon me. <span id="calibre_link-33726" class="verse-num">15</span>And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling.

<p id="calibre_link-33727" class="heading">A Watchman for Israel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And at the end of seven days, the word of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came to me: <span id="calibre_link-11543" class="verse-num">17</span>"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel.

None of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. <span id="calibre_link-33791" class="verse-num">12</span>The time has come; the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. <span id="calibre_link-33792" class="verse-num">13</span>For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live.

Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal. <span id="calibre_link-9035" class="verse-num">3</span>He put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. <span id="calibre_link-33806" class="verse-num">4</span>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the valley.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33807"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy. <span id="calibre_link-33808" class="verse-num">6</span>And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33809"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall. <span id="calibre_link-33810" class="verse-num">8</span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall." So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance. <span id="calibre_link-33811" class="verse-num">9</span>And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here." <span id="calibre_link-33812" class="verse-num">10</span>So I went in and saw. And there, engraved on the wall all around, was every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-2926" class="verse-num">11</span>And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up. <span id="calibre_link-33813" class="verse-num">12</span>Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each in his room of pictures? For they say, 'The L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> does not see us, the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has forsaken the land.'" <span id="calibre_link-33814" class="verse-num">13</span>He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations that they commit."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33815"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. <span id="calibre_link-33816" class="verse-num">15</span>Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these."</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33817"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. And behold, at the entrance of the temple of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east. <span id="calibre_link-33818" class="verse-num">17</span>Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger? Behold, they put the branch to their nose. <span id="calibre_link-33819" class="verse-num">18</span>Therefore I will act in wrath. My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33821"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house.

Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity. <span id="calibre_link-4409" class="verse-num">6</span>Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house. <span id="calibre_link-33823" class="verse-num">7</span>Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out." So they went out and struck in the city. <span id="calibre_link-3565" class="verse-num">8</span>And while they were striking, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, "Ah, Lord G<span class="calibre11">OD</span>! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33824"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Then he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-33826"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, "I have done as you commanded me."</p>

<p class="crossway">And he went in before my eyes. <span id="calibre_link-33828" class="verse-num">3</span>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. <span id="calibre_link-33829" class="verse-num">4</span>And the glory of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-9843" class="verse-num">5</span>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</p>
