<p id="calibre_link-16118" class="heading">The Birth of Samuel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1971">1 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <span id="calibre_link-23480" class="verse-num">2</span>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8319"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-23481" class="verse-num">4</span>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. <span id="calibre_link-23482" class="verse-num">5</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> had closed her womb. <span id="calibre_link-23483" class="verse-num">6</span>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> had closed her womb. <span id="calibre_link-23484" class="verse-num">7</span>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. <span id="calibre_link-6927" class="verse-num">8</span>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23485"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-23486" class="verse-num">10</span>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> and wept bitterly. <span id="calibre_link-23487" class="verse-num">11</span>And she vowed a vow and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;O L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23488"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>As she continued praying before the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, Eli observed her mouth. <span id="calibre_link-23489" class="verse-num">13</span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. <span id="calibre_link-895" class="verse-num">14</span>And Eli said to her, &acirc;&#128;&#156;How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23490" class="verse-num">15</span>But Hannah answered, &acirc;&#128;&#156;No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-23491" class="verse-num">16</span>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-8295" class="verse-num">17</span>Then Eli answered, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23492" class="verse-num">18</span>And she said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let your servant find favor in your eyes.&acirc;&#128;&#157; Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-15461"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> remembered her. <span id="calibre_link-6986" class="verse-num">20</span>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I have asked for him from the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-23493" class="heading">Samuel Given to the L<span class="smallcap">ORD</span></p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. <span id="calibre_link-23494" class="verse-num">22</span>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, &acirc;&#128;&#156;As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> and dwell there forever.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23495" class="verse-num">23</span>Elkanah her husband said to her, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> establish his word.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. <span id="calibre_link-23496" class="verse-num">24</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> at Shiloh. And the child was young. <span id="calibre_link-23497" class="verse-num">25</span>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. <span id="calibre_link-23498" class="verse-num">26</span>And she said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-23499" class="verse-num">27</span>For this child I prayed, and the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has granted me my petition that I made to him. <span id="calibre_link-23500" class="verse-num">28</span>Therefore I have lent him to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>.

<p class="crossway">And he worshiped the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> there.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-4586" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy was ministering to the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> in the presence of Eli the priest.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-23504" class="heading">Eli&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Worthless Sons</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>. <span id="calibre_link-23505" class="verse-num">13</span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&acirc;&#128;&#153;s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <span id="calibre_link-23506" class="verse-num">14</span>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. <span id="calibre_link-23507" class="verse-num">15</span>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest&acirc;&#128;&#153;s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23508" class="verse-num">16</span>And if the man said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,&acirc;&#128;&#157; he would say, &acirc;&#128;&#156;No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23509" class="verse-num">17</span>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, for the men treated the offering of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> with contempt.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23510"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Samuel was ministering before the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. <span id="calibre_link-23511" class="verse-num">19</span>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <span id="calibre_link-23512" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, &acirc;&#128;&#156;May the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So then they would return to their home.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <span id="calibre_link-23514" class="verse-num">23</span>And he said to them, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Why do you do such things?

I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-23520" class="verse-num">29</span>Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded for my dwelling, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?&acirc;&#128;&#153; <span id="calibre_link-15881" class="verse-num">30</span>Therefore the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, declares: &acirc;&#128;&#152;I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,&acirc;&#128;&#153; but now the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> declares: &acirc;&#128;&#152;Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <span id="calibre_link-23521" class="verse-num">31</span>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father&acirc;&#128;&#153;s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. <span id="calibre_link-23522" class="verse-num">32</span>Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever. <span id="calibre_link-23523" class="verse-num">33</span>The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men. <span id="calibre_link-23524" class="verse-num">34</span>And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day. <span id="calibre_link-8573" class="verse-num">35</span>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind.

And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23700"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven. <span id="calibre_link-2911" class="verse-num">6</span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns, <span id="calibre_link-23701" class="verse-num">7</span>and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel.

For then the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. <span id="calibre_link-4372" class="verse-num">14</span>But now your kingdom shall not continue. The L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has sought out a man after his own heart, and the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> commanded you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23708" class="verse-num">15</span>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal.

<p class="crossway">And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. <span id="calibre_link-1355" class="verse-num">16</span>And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. <span id="calibre_link-23709" class="verse-num">17</span>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23711"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23712" class="verse-num">20</span>But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle, <span id="calibre_link-23713" class="verse-num">21</span>and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads. <span id="calibre_link-23714" class="verse-num">22</span>So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. <span id="calibre_link-23715" class="verse-num">23</span>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1971">1 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 14 </span>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.&acirc;&#128;&#157; But he did not tell his father. <span id="calibre_link-23716" class="verse-num">2</span>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men, <span id="calibre_link-23717" class="verse-num">3</span>including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod&acirc;&#128;&#153;s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. <span id="calibre_link-23718" class="verse-num">4</span>Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <span id="calibre_link-23719" class="verse-num">5</span>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23720"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> will work for us, for nothing can hinder the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> from saving by many or by few.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23721" class="verse-num">7</span>And his armor-bearer said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23722" class="verse-num">8</span>Then Jonathan said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. <span id="calibre_link-23723" class="verse-num">9</span>If they say to us, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Wait until we come to you,&acirc;&#128;&#153; then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. <span id="calibre_link-23724" class="verse-num">10</span>But if they say, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Come up to us,&acirc;&#128;&#153; then we will go up, for the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23725" class="verse-num">11</span>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23726" class="verse-num">12</span>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Come up after me, for the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has given them into the hand of Israel.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23727" class="verse-num">13</span>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him. <span id="calibre_link-23728" class="verse-num">14</span>And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow&acirc;&#128;&#153;s length in an acre of land. <span id="calibre_link-23729" class="verse-num">15</span>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23730"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there. <span id="calibre_link-23731" class="verse-num">17</span>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Count and see who has gone from us.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. <span id="calibre_link-23732" class="verse-num">18</span>So Saul said to Ahijah, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Bring the ark of God here.&acirc;&#128;&#157; For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. <span id="calibre_link-23733" class="verse-num">19</span>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Withdraw your hand.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23734" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine&acirc;&#128;&#153;s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. <span id="calibre_link-23735" class="verse-num">21</span>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <span id="calibre_link-23736" class="verse-num">22</span>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. <span id="calibre_link-23737" class="verse-num">23</span>So the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> saved Israel that day.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.&acirc;&#128;&#157; So none of the people had tasted food. <span id="calibre_link-23739" class="verse-num">25</span>Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground. <span id="calibre_link-23740" class="verse-num">26</span>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. <span id="calibre_link-23741" class="verse-num">27</span>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright. <span id="calibre_link-23742" class="verse-num">28</span>Then one of the people said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Cursed be the man who eats food this day.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157; And the people were faint. <span id="calibre_link-23743" class="verse-num">29</span>Then Jonathan said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;My father has troubled the land.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23745"> <span class="verse-num">31</span>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>As they were coming home, when David returned from striking down the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy, and with musical instruments. <span id="calibre_link-7048" class="verse-num">7</span>And the women sang to one another as they celebrated,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Saul has struck down his thousands,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-23861" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23863"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand. <span id="calibre_link-23864" class="verse-num">11</span>And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will pin David to the wall.&acirc;&#128;&#157; But David evaded him twice.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23865"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Saul was afraid of David because the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> was with him but had departed from Saul. <span id="calibre_link-23866" class="verse-num">13</span>So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people. <span id="calibre_link-7905" class="verse-num">14</span>And David had success in all his undertakings, for the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> was with him. <span id="calibre_link-23867" class="verse-num">15</span>And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him. <span id="calibre_link-23868" class="verse-num">16</span>But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-23869" class="heading">David Marries Michal</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Then Saul said to David, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>&acirc;&#128;&#153;s battles.&acirc;&#128;&#157; For Saul thought, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23870" class="verse-num">18</span>And David said to Saul, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father&acirc;&#128;&#153;s clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23871" class="verse-num">19</span>But at the time when Merab, Saul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4543"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>Now Saul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s daughter Michal loved David.

Before the time had expired, <span id="calibre_link-23878" class="verse-num">27</span>David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king&acirc;&#128;&#153;s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife. <span id="calibre_link-23879" class="verse-num">28</span>But when Saul saw and knew that the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> was with David, and that Michal, Saul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s daughter, loved him, <span id="calibre_link-23880" class="verse-num">29</span>Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s enemy continually.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23881"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.</p>

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1971">1 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 19 </span>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan, Saul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s son, delighted much in David. <span id="calibre_link-23882" class="verse-num">2</span>And Jonathan told David, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Saul my father seeks to kill you. Therefore be on your guard in the morning. Stay in a secret place and hide yourself. <span id="calibre_link-23883" class="verse-num">3</span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak to my father about you. And if I learn anything I will tell you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-1356" class="verse-num">4</span>And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his deeds have brought good to you. <span id="calibre_link-23884" class="verse-num">5</span>For he took his life in his hand and he struck down the Philistine, and the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> worked a great salvation for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23885" class="verse-num">6</span>And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan. Saul swore, &acirc;&#128;&#156;As the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> lives, he shall not be put to death.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23886" class="verse-num">7</span>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported to him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23887"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>And there was war again. And David went out and fought with the Philistines and struck them with a great blow, so that they fled before him. <span id="calibre_link-23888" class="verse-num">9</span>Then a harmful spirit from the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing the lyre. <span id="calibre_link-23889" class="verse-num">10</span>And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23890"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Saul sent messengers to David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning.

Why should I kill you?&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23896"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and lived at Naioth. <span id="calibre_link-23897" class="verse-num">19</span>And it was told Saul, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23898" class="verse-num">20</span>Then Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. <span id="calibre_link-23899" class="verse-num">21</span>When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied. <span id="calibre_link-6991" class="verse-num">22</span>Then he himself went to Ramah and came to the great well that is in Secu. And he asked, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Where are Samuel and David?&acirc;&#128;&#157; And one said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23900" class="verse-num">23</span>And he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah. <span id="calibre_link-7049" class="verse-num">24</span>And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel and lay naked all that day and all that night. Thus it is said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Is Saul also among the prophets?&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-16132" class="heading">Jonathan Warns David</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1971">1 SAMUEL</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 20 </span>Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, &acirc;&#128;&#156;What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23901" class="verse-num">2</span>And he said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Far from it!

It is not so.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23902" class="verse-num">3</span>But David vowed again, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he thinks, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.&acirc;&#128;&#153; But truly, as the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23903" class="verse-num">4</span>Then Jonathan said to David, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Whatever you say, I will do for you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23904" class="verse-num">5</span>David said to Jonathan, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king.

When I have sounded out my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you? <span id="calibre_link-23912" class="verse-num">13</span>But should it please my father to do you harm, the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> do so to Jonathan and more also if I do not disclose it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> be with you, as he has been with my father. <span id="calibre_link-23913" class="verse-num">14</span>If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span>, that I may not die; <span id="calibre_link-23914" class="verse-num">15</span>and do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever, when the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23915" class="verse-num">16</span>And Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;May the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> take vengeance on David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s enemies.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-23916" class="verse-num">17</span>And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23917"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Then Jonathan said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <span id="calibre_link-23918" class="verse-num">19</span>On the third day go down quickly to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside the stone heap. <span id="calibre_link-10133" class="verse-num">20</span>And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark. <span id="calibre_link-23919" class="verse-num">21</span>And behold, I will send the boy, saying, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Go, find the arrows.&acirc;&#128;&#153; If I say to the boy, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,&acirc;&#128;&#153; then you are to come, for, as the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger. <span id="calibre_link-23920" class="verse-num">22</span>But if I say to the youth, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Look, the arrows are beyond you,&acirc;&#128;&#153; then go, for the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> has sent you away. <span id="calibre_link-23921" class="verse-num">23</span>And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the L<span class="calibre11">ORD</span> is between you and me forever.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23922"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>So David hid himself in the field.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23923"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Something has happened to him.

So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away and see my brothers.&acirc;&#128;&#153; For this reason he has not come to the king&acirc;&#128;&#153;s table.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-23927"> <span class="verse-num">30</span>Then Saul&acirc;&#128;&#153;s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother&acirc;&#128;&#153;s nakedness? <span id="calibre_link-23928" class="verse-num">31</span>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24020"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>When David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David, and then they waited. <span id="calibre_link-24021" class="verse-num">10</span>And Nabal answered David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s servants, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Who is David?

There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters. <span id="calibre_link-24022" class="verse-num">11</span>Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it to men who come from I do not know where?&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-24023" class="verse-num">12</span>So David&acirc;&#128;&#153;s young men turned away and came back and told him all this. <span id="calibre_link-24024" class="verse-num">13</span>And David said to his men, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Every man strap on his sword!&acirc;&#128;&#157; And every man of them strapped on his sword.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24025"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal&acirc;&#128;&#153;s wife, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them. <span id="calibre_link-24026" class="verse-num">15</span>Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them. <span id="calibre_link-24027" class="verse-num">16</span>They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <span id="calibre_link-24028" class="verse-num">17</span>Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-24029"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys. <span id="calibre_link-24030" class="verse-num">19</span>And she said to her young men, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Go on before me; behold, I come after you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; But she did not tell her husband Nabal. <span id="calibre_link-24031" class="verse-num">20</span>And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. <span id="calibre_link-24032" class="verse-num">21</span>Now David had said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good. <span id="calibre_link-24033" class="verse-num">22</span>God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9597"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground. <span id="calibre_link-24034" class="verse-num">24</span>She fell at his feet and said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;On me alone, my lord, be the guilt.

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9608"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab&acirc;&#128;&#153;s brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?&acirc;&#128;&#157; And Abishai said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will go down with you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-7050" class="verse-num">7</span>So David and Abishai went to the army by night.
