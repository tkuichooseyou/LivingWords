<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, <span id="calibre_link-207" class="verse-num">2</span>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. <span id="calibre_link-5029" class="verse-num">3</span>He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, <span id="calibre_link-7943" class="verse-num">4</span>having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12832"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>For to which of the angels did God ever say,</p>

<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-8809" class="verse-num">9</span> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;</p>

<p id="calibre_link-10241" class="heading">Warning Against Neglecting Salvation</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. <span id="calibre_link-726" class="verse-num">2</span>For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, <span id="calibre_link-5074" class="verse-num">3</span>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, <span id="calibre_link-4597" class="verse-num">4</span>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7885" class="heading">The Founder of Salvation</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. <span id="calibre_link-2857" class="verse-num">6</span>It has been testified somewhere,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;What is man, that you are mindful of him,</p>
<p class="line-indent">or the son of man, that you care for him?</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-4141" class="verse-num">7</span> You made him for a little while lower than the angels;</p>
<p class="line-indent">you have crowned him with glory and honor,</p>
<p class="line-indent"><span id="calibre_link-7889" class="verse-num">8</span> putting everything in subjection under his feet.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. <span id="calibre_link-3599" class="verse-num">9</span>But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7924"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. <span id="calibre_link-7004" class="verse-num">11</span>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, <span id="calibre_link-3358" class="verse-num">12</span>saying,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will tell of your name to my brothers;</p>
<p class="line-indent">in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11014" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>And again,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;I will put my trust in him.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">And again,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, I and the children God has given me.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-263" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, <span id="calibre_link-7562" class="verse-num">15</span>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. <span id="calibre_link-38781" class="verse-num">16</span>For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. <span id="calibre_link-8236" class="verse-num">17</span>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. <span id="calibre_link-7919" class="verse-num">18</span>For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1296" class="heading">Jesus Greater Than Moses</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, <span id="calibre_link-38782" class="verse-num">2</span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s house. <span id="calibre_link-3472" class="verse-num">3</span>For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses&mdash;as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. <span id="calibre_link-13094" class="verse-num">4</span>(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) <span id="calibre_link-4673" class="verse-num">5</span>Now Moses was faithful in all God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, <span id="calibre_link-3346" class="verse-num">6</span>but Christ is faithful over God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1859" class="heading">A Rest for the People of God</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-15393" class="verse-num">8</span> do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,</p>
<p class="line-indent">on the day of testing in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-38783" class="verse-num">9</span> where your fathers put me to the test</p>
<p class="line-indent">and saw my works for forty years.</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-10215" class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore I was provoked with that generation,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">and said, &acirc;&#128;&#152;They always go astray in their heart;</p>

<p id="calibre_link-16975" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. <span id="calibre_link-292" class="verse-num">13</span>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called &acirc;&#128;&#156;today,&acirc;&#128;&#157; that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. <span id="calibre_link-38785" class="verse-num">14</span>For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. <span id="calibre_link-38786" class="verse-num">15</span>As it is said,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Today, if you hear his voice,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38787" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? <span id="calibre_link-38788" class="verse-num">17</span>And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? <span id="calibre_link-38789" class="verse-num">18</span>And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? <span id="calibre_link-16970" class="verse-num">19</span>So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12208"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. <span id="calibre_link-5821" class="verse-num">2</span>For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. <span id="calibre_link-12865" class="verse-num">3</span>For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;As I swore in my wrath,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">&acirc;&#128;&#152;They shall not enter my rest,&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="no-indent-line-space">although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. <span id="calibre_link-7311" class="verse-num">4</span>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: &acirc;&#128;&#156;And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38790" class="verse-num">5</span>And again in this passage he said,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;They shall not enter my rest.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-12141" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, <span id="calibre_link-38791" class="verse-num">7</span>again he appoints a certain day, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Today,&acirc;&#128;&#157; saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Today, if you hear his voice,</p>

<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38793"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. <span id="calibre_link-3995" class="verse-num">12</span>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. <span id="calibre_link-3557" class="verse-num">13</span>And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1297" class="heading">Jesus the Great High Priest</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. <span id="calibre_link-7481" class="verse-num">15</span>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. <span id="calibre_link-3347" class="verse-num">16</span>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-6926"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 5 </span>For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. <span id="calibre_link-9030" class="verse-num">2</span>He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness. <span id="calibre_link-6920" class="verse-num">3</span>Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. <span id="calibre_link-9568" class="verse-num">4</span>And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-13426"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;You are my Son,</p>
<p class="line-indent">today I have begotten you&acirc;&#128;&#157;;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8575" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>as he says also in another place,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;You are a priest forever,</p>
<p class="line-indent">after the order of Melchizedek.&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-7951" class="line-space"> <span class="verse-num">7</span>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence. <span id="calibre_link-7920" class="verse-num">8</span>Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered. <span id="calibre_link-8775" class="verse-num">9</span>And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, <span id="calibre_link-4492" class="verse-num">10</span>being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-917" class="heading">Warning Against Apostasy</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing. <span id="calibre_link-4563" class="verse-num">12</span>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, <span id="calibre_link-38794" class="verse-num">13</span>for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. <span id="calibre_link-666" class="verse-num">14</span>But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-805"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 6 </span>Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, <span id="calibre_link-38795" class="verse-num">2</span>and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. <span id="calibre_link-38796" class="verse-num">3</span>And this we will do if God permits. <span id="calibre_link-10692" class="verse-num">4</span>For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, <span id="calibre_link-8480" class="verse-num">5</span>and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, <span id="calibre_link-3398" class="verse-num">6</span>and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt. <span id="calibre_link-8609" class="verse-num">7</span>For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. <span id="calibre_link-38797" class="verse-num">8</span>But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-12872"> <span class="verse-num">9</span>Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things&mdash;things that belong to salvation. <span id="calibre_link-11750" class="verse-num">10</span>For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do. <span id="calibre_link-10205" class="verse-num">11</span>And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end, <span id="calibre_link-9046" class="verse-num">12</span>so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38798" class="heading">The Certainty of God&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Promise</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, <span id="calibre_link-4729" class="verse-num">14</span>saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Surely I will bless you and multiply you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38799" class="verse-num">15</span>And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise. <span id="calibre_link-38800" class="verse-num">16</span>For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. <span id="calibre_link-2959" class="verse-num">17</span>So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, <span id="calibre_link-3888" class="verse-num">18</span>so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. <span id="calibre_link-9901" class="verse-num">19</span>We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain, <span id="calibre_link-12344" class="verse-num">20</span>where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4493" class="heading">The Priestly Order of Melchizedek</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 7 </span>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, <span id="calibre_link-10752" class="verse-num">2</span>and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace. <span id="calibre_link-12830" class="verse-num">3</span>He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38801"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils! <span id="calibre_link-38802" class="verse-num">5</span>And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham. <span id="calibre_link-38803" class="verse-num">6</span>But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. <span id="calibre_link-7944" class="verse-num">7</span>It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior. <span id="calibre_link-38804" class="verse-num">8</span>In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives. <span id="calibre_link-38805" class="verse-num">9</span>One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, <span id="calibre_link-38806" class="verse-num">10</span>for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8245" class="heading">Jesus Compared to Melchizedek</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron? <span id="calibre_link-38807" class="verse-num">12</span>For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well. <span id="calibre_link-38808" class="verse-num">13</span>For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. <span id="calibre_link-1419" class="verse-num">14</span>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38809"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, <span id="calibre_link-9069" class="verse-num">16</span>who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life. <span id="calibre_link-38810" class="verse-num">17</span>For it is witnessed of him,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;You are a priest forever,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-38811" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness <span id="calibre_link-3768" class="verse-num">19</span>(for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38812"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath, <span id="calibre_link-2953" class="verse-num">21</span>but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him:</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Lord has sworn</p>
<p class="line-indent">and will not change his mind,</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading">&acirc;&#128;&#152;You are a priest forever.&acirc;&#128;&#153;&acirc;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1298" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">22</span>This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38813"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, <span id="calibre_link-8577" class="verse-num">24</span>but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. <span id="calibre_link-3987" class="verse-num">25</span>Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7263"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. <span id="calibre_link-8825" class="verse-num">27</span>He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. <span id="calibre_link-38814" class="verse-num">28</span>For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4353" class="heading">Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 8 </span>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, <span id="calibre_link-4585" class="verse-num">2</span>a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man. <span id="calibre_link-38815" class="verse-num">3</span>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. <span id="calibre_link-38816" class="verse-num">4</span>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. <span id="calibre_link-3433" class="verse-num">5</span>They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things.

<p id="calibre_link-16066" class="heading">The Earthly Holy Place</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 9 </span>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness. <span id="calibre_link-3719" class="verse-num">2</span>For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place. <span id="calibre_link-38819" class="verse-num">3</span>Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place, <span id="calibre_link-7755" class="verse-num">4</span>having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron&acirc;&#128;&#153;s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. <span id="calibre_link-2986" class="verse-num">5</span>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38820"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties, <span id="calibre_link-38821" class="verse-num">7</span>but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people. <span id="calibre_link-38822" class="verse-num">8</span>By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing <span id="calibre_link-11783" class="verse-num">9</span>(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper, <span id="calibre_link-38823" class="verse-num">10</span>but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10749" class="heading">Redemption Through the Blood of Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation) <span id="calibre_link-8355" class="verse-num">12</span>he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption. <span id="calibre_link-7752" class="verse-num">13</span>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh, <span id="calibre_link-7294" class="verse-num">14</span>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4473"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant. <span id="calibre_link-38824" class="verse-num">16</span>For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established. <span id="calibre_link-13291" class="verse-num">17</span>For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive. <span id="calibre_link-38825" class="verse-num">18</span>Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood. <span id="calibre_link-38826" class="verse-num">19</span>For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, <span id="calibre_link-38827" class="verse-num">20</span>saying, &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-38828" class="verse-num">21</span>And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. <span id="calibre_link-7357" class="verse-num">22</span>Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38829"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <span id="calibre_link-8552" class="verse-num">24</span>For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. <span id="calibre_link-38830" class="verse-num">25</span>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, <span id="calibre_link-6921" class="verse-num">26</span>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. <span id="calibre_link-601" class="verse-num">27</span>And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, <span id="calibre_link-7175" class="verse-num">28</span>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-1104" class="heading">Christ&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Sacrifice Once for All</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2011">HEBREWS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 10 </span>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. <span id="calibre_link-3130" class="verse-num">2</span>Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? <span id="calibre_link-38831" class="verse-num">3</span>But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. <span id="calibre_link-13904" class="verse-num">4</span>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8800"> <span class="verse-num">5</span>Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,</p>
<p class="line-group"> &acirc;&#128;&#156;Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,</p>
<p class="line-indent">but a body have you prepared for me;</p>

<p class="line-indent">you have taken no pleasure.</p>
<p class="line-group-after-heading"><span id="calibre_link-38833" class="verse-num">7</span> Then I said, &acirc;&#128;&#152;Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,</p>

<p id="calibre_link-38834" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>When he said above, &acirc;&#128;&#156;You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings&acirc;&#128;&#157; (these are offered according to the law), <span id="calibre_link-38835" class="verse-num">9</span>then he added, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Behold, I have come to do your will.&acirc;&#128;&#157; He does away with the first in order to establish the second. <span id="calibre_link-7002" class="verse-num">10</span>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38836"> <span class="verse-num">11</span>And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. <span id="calibre_link-3050" class="verse-num">12</span>But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, <span id="calibre_link-12333" class="verse-num">13</span>waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. <span id="calibre_link-8242" class="verse-num">14</span>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-11690"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</p>
<p id="calibre_link-11809" class="line-group"> <span class="verse-num">16</span> &acirc;&#128;&#156;This is the covenant that I will make with them</p>

<p id="calibre_link-38838" class="no-indent-line-space"> <span class="verse-num">18</span>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-3348" class="heading">The Full Assurance of Faith</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, <span id="calibre_link-3654" class="verse-num">20</span>by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, <span id="calibre_link-38839" class="verse-num">21</span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God, <span id="calibre_link-857" class="verse-num">22</span>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. <span id="calibre_link-3341" class="verse-num">23</span>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. <span id="calibre_link-4109" class="verse-num">24</span>And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, <span id="calibre_link-198" class="verse-num">25</span>not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7516"> <span class="verse-num">26</span>For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, <span id="calibre_link-1456" class="verse-num">27</span>but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. <span id="calibre_link-38840" class="verse-num">28</span>Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. <span id="calibre_link-8703" class="verse-num">29</span>How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? <span id="calibre_link-1800" class="verse-num">30</span>For we know him who said, &acirc;&#128;&#156;Vengeance is mine; I will repay.&acirc;&#128;&#157; And again, &acirc;&#128;&#156;The Lord will judge his people.&acirc;&#128;&#157; <span id="calibre_link-12163" class="verse-num">31</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
