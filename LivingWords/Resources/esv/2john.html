<p id="calibre_link-16102" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2016">2 JOHN</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, <span id="calibre_link-12350" class="verse-num">2</span>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38910"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father&acirc;&#128;&#153;s Son, in truth and love.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38911" class="heading">Walking in Truth and Love</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. <span id="calibre_link-38912" class="verse-num">5</span>And now I ask you, dear lady&mdash;not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning&mdash;that we love one another. <span id="calibre_link-11501" class="verse-num">6</span>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. <span id="calibre_link-304" class="verse-num">7</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. <span id="calibre_link-4072" class="verse-num">8</span>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. <span id="calibre_link-9593" class="verse-num">9</span>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. <span id="calibre_link-38913" class="verse-num">10</span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, <span id="calibre_link-38914" class="verse-num">11</span>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9106" class="heading">Final Greetings</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38915"> <span class="verse-num">13</span>The children of your elect sister greet you.</p>
