<p id="calibre_link-209" class="heading">Greeting</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1604">PHILIPPIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 1 </span>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="crossway">To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38632"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-10799" class="heading">Thanksgiving and Prayer</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">3</span>I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, <span id="calibre_link-38633" class="verse-num">4</span>always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, <span id="calibre_link-38634" class="verse-num">5</span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. <span id="calibre_link-195" class="verse-num">6</span>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-8164" class="verse-num">7</span>It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. <span id="calibre_link-9758" class="verse-num">8</span>For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-665" class="verse-num">9</span>And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, <span id="calibre_link-12943" class="verse-num">10</span>so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, <span id="calibre_link-12253" class="verse-num">11</span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38635" class="heading">The Advance of the Gospel</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, <span id="calibre_link-38636" class="verse-num">13</span>so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. <span id="calibre_link-9055" class="verse-num">14</span>And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-8524"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. <span id="calibre_link-351" class="verse-num">16</span>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. <span id="calibre_link-9762" class="verse-num">17</span>The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. <span id="calibre_link-38637" class="verse-num">18</span>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.</p>
<p class="heading">To Live Is Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> Yes, and I will rejoice, <span id="calibre_link-385" class="verse-num">19</span>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, <span id="calibre_link-3480" class="verse-num">20</span>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. <span id="calibre_link-600" class="verse-num">21</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span id="calibre_link-12403" class="verse-num">22</span>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. <span id="calibre_link-487" class="verse-num">23</span>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. <span id="calibre_link-15456" class="verse-num">24</span>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. <span id="calibre_link-3431" class="verse-num">25</span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, <span id="calibre_link-2908" class="verse-num">26</span>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-4405"> <span class="verse-num">27</span>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, <span id="calibre_link-7441" class="verse-num">28</span>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. <span id="calibre_link-7915" class="verse-num">29</span>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, <span id="calibre_link-38638" class="verse-num">30</span>engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-2448" class="heading">Christ's Example of Humility</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1604">PHILIPPIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, <span id="calibre_link-1400" class="verse-num">2</span>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. <span id="calibre_link-3309" class="verse-num">3</span>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. <span id="calibre_link-4028" class="verse-num">4</span>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. <span id="calibre_link-4572" class="verse-num">5</span>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, <span id="calibre_link-13379" class="verse-num">6</span>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, <span id="calibre_link-3939" class="verse-num">7</span>but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. <span id="calibre_link-260" class="verse-num">8</span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. <span id="calibre_link-4980" class="verse-num">9</span>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, <span id="calibre_link-12573" class="verse-num">10</span>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, <span id="calibre_link-10902" class="verse-num">11</span>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-6970" class="heading">Lights in the World</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, <span id="calibre_link-8407" class="verse-num">13</span>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-14002"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Do all things without grumbling or disputing, <span id="calibre_link-3573" class="verse-num">15</span>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, <span id="calibre_link-1774" class="verse-num">16</span>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. <span id="calibre_link-38639" class="verse-num">17</span>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. <span id="calibre_link-38640" class="verse-num">18</span>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38641" class="heading">Timothy and Epaphroditus</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">19</span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. <span id="calibre_link-38642" class="verse-num">20</span>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. <span id="calibre_link-38643" class="verse-num">21</span>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. <span id="calibre_link-7639" class="verse-num">22</span>But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. <span id="calibre_link-38644" class="verse-num">23</span>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, <span id="calibre_link-38645" class="verse-num">24</span>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38646"> <span class="verse-num">25</span>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, <span id="calibre_link-38647" class="verse-num">26</span>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. <span id="calibre_link-7659" class="verse-num">27</span>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. <span id="calibre_link-38648" class="verse-num">28</span>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. <span id="calibre_link-38649" class="verse-num">29</span>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, <span id="calibre_link-38650" class="verse-num">30</span>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-2449" class="heading">Righteousness Through Faith in Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1604">PHILIPPIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 3 </span>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38651"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. <span id="calibre_link-3087" class="verse-num">3</span>For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh- <span id="calibre_link-38652" class="verse-num">4</span>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: <span id="calibre_link-3082" class="verse-num">5</span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; <span id="calibre_link-8092" class="verse-num">6</span>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. <span id="calibre_link-3471" class="verse-num">7</span>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. <span id="calibre_link-3467" class="verse-num">8</span>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ <span id="calibre_link-445" class="verse-num">9</span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith- <span id="calibre_link-261" class="verse-num">10</span>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <span id="calibre_link-225" class="verse-num">11</span>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-4335" class="heading">Straining Toward the Goal</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">12</span>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. <span id="calibre_link-12356" class="verse-num">13</span>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, <span id="calibre_link-2793" class="verse-num">14</span>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-4458" class="verse-num">15</span>Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. <span id="calibre_link-10236" class="verse-num">16</span>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38653"> <span class="verse-num">17</span>Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. <span id="calibre_link-10717" class="verse-num">18</span>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. <span id="calibre_link-7338" class="verse-num">19</span>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. <span id="calibre_link-3098" class="verse-num">20</span>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, <span id="calibre_link-7882" class="verse-num">21</span>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-2450"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-1604">PHILIPPIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 4 </span>Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-9800" class="heading">Exhortation, Encouragement, and Prayer</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">2</span>I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord. <span id="calibre_link-4994" class="verse-num">3</span>Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women, who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-9870"> <span class="verse-num">4</span>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. <span id="calibre_link-38654" class="verse-num">5</span>Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; <span id="calibre_link-7949" class="verse-num">6</span>do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. <span id="calibre_link-7956" class="verse-num">7</span>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-10818"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. <span id="calibre_link-38655" class="verse-num">9</span>What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me-practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-8843" class="heading">God's Provision</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">10</span>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. <span id="calibre_link-3401" class="verse-num">11</span>Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. <span id="calibre_link-4139" class="verse-num">12</span>I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. <span id="calibre_link-7843" class="verse-num">13</span>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38656"> <span class="verse-num">14</span>Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. <span id="calibre_link-38657" class="verse-num">15</span>And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. <span id="calibre_link-5063" class="verse-num">16</span>Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. <span id="calibre_link-38658" class="verse-num">17</span>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. <span id="calibre_link-6919" class="verse-num">18</span>I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. <span id="calibre_link-5059" class="verse-num">19</span>And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. <span id="calibre_link-38659" class="verse-num">20</span>To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-38660" class="heading">Final Greetings</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. <span id="calibre_link-38661" class="verse-num">22</span>All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-38662"> <span class="verse-num">23</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
