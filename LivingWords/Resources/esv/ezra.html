<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>I gathered them to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we camped three days.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">21</span>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our goods. <span id="calibre_link-27877" class="verse-num">22</span>For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king, "The hand of our God is for good on all who seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all who forsake him." <span id="calibre_link-12183" class="verse-num">23</span>So we fasted and implored our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.</p>
