<p id="calibre_link-3549" class="heading">The Preeminence of Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">15</span>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. <span id="calibre_link-3544" class="verse-num">16</span>For by<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-14789" id="calibre_link-4311">[6]</a></span> him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities&mdash;all things were created through him and for him. <span id="calibre_link-10816" class="verse-num">17</span>And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <span id="calibre_link-8541" class="verse-num">18</span>And he is the head of the body, the church.

<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">24</span>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, <span id="calibre_link-7788" class="verse-num">25</span>of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, <span id="calibre_link-4757" class="verse-num">26</span>the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. <span id="calibre_link-13862" class="verse-num">27</span>To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <span id="calibre_link-4459" class="verse-num">28</span>Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. <span id="calibre_link-38669" class="verse-num">29</span>For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-7859"> <span class="book-name"><a href="#calibre_link-2004">COLOSSIANS</a></span><span class="chapter-num"> 2 </span>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, <span id="calibre_link-10204" class="verse-num">2</span>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God’s mystery, which is Christ, <span id="calibre_link-10953" class="verse-num">3</span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. <span id="calibre_link-10085" class="verse-num">4</span>I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments. <span id="calibre_link-8856" class="verse-num">5</span>For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-15405" class="heading">Alive in Christ</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">6</span>Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, <span id="calibre_link-10810" class="verse-num">7</span>rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-2844"> <span class="verse-num">8</span>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-14791" id="calibre_link-4313">[1]</a></span> of the world, and not according to Christ. <span id="calibre_link-948" class="verse-num">9</span>For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, <span id="calibre_link-15601" class="verse-num">10</span>and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. <span id="calibre_link-3083" class="verse-num">11</span>In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, <span id="calibre_link-226" class="verse-num">12</span>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. <span id="calibre_link-12361" class="verse-num">13</span>And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, <span id="calibre_link-276" class="verse-num">14</span>by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. <span id="calibre_link-648" class="verse-num">15</span>He disarmed the rulers and authorities<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-14792" id="calibre_link-4314">[2]</a></span> and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-14793" id="calibre_link-4315">[3]</a></span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1455" class="heading">Let No One Disqualify You</p>
<p class="calibre9"> <span class="verse-num">16</span>Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. <span id="calibre_link-7322" class="verse-num">17</span>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. <span id="calibre_link-8693" class="verse-num">18</span>Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions,<span class="footnote">&nbsp;<a href="#calibre_link-14794" id="calibre_link-4316">[4]</a></span> puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, <span id="calibre_link-12584" class="verse-num">19</span>and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.</p>
<p class="crossway" id="calibre_link-607"> <span class="verse-num">20</span>If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations&mdash; <span id="calibre_link-10690" class="verse-num">21</span>“Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch” <span id="calibre_link-10709" class="verse-num">22</span>(referring to things that all perish as they are used)&mdash;according to human precepts and teachings? <span id="calibre_link-10034" class="verse-num">23</span>These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.</p>
